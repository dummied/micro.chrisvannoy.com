			 <p>Experimented with my aeropress recipe, changing the water from 180 to 185.</p>

<p>And was astonished by the difference. In a bad way!</p>

<p>Said recipe:</p>

<p>20 grams coffee - 8.5 on encore grinder
180-deg water (third wave classic)
100 grams water. Stir
100 grams water. Plug, wait 2min

<p>In a recent life, I used to joke that I was in charge of all the &ldquo;creepy stuff&rdquo; at a Marketing Technology startup.</p>

<p>I was a product manager in charge of things like identifying anonymous visitors, intent (more on this soon) and advertising targeting.</p>

<p>I helped build systems which would take an ip address, triangulate it between different sources of identification and settle on what company or account to attribute it to in a world at the time where most everybody was working from home.</p>

<p>Along the way, I talked with lots of providers of third-party identification and intent about what they had and how they do things so we could integrate it into our own systems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not in that world anymore, and don&rsquo;t particularly care to get back into it, so let&rsquo;s talk a bit about how it all works. And why <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/retentionadam_over-the-past-60-days-my-coo-and-i-have-activity-7154587668578816000-9Gir">this dude</a> is about to have a bad time - even if he&rsquo;s right about a lot of it!</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>So, for those not deep in this space, let&rsquo;s talk about marketing.</p>

<p>Marketers at Business To Business (B2B) startups - newish companies, largely fed by venture funding, and largely selling to one another - are increasingly tied to sales teams and revenue numbers as part of an overall Go To Market (GTM) strategy (this space <em>loves</em> their acronyms).</p>

<p>As part of that, sales hunger for leads - folks to talk to about buying their software or services. And sales drives revenue, and revenue drives venture funding and so forth. When it&rsquo;s working well, it&rsquo;s all a very fun and somewhat virtuous cycle.</p>

<p>So a lot of marketing has become sales assistance and support as a primary driver. There are still some folks doing squishier &ldquo;brand awareness&rdquo; marketing but they&rsquo;re few and far between.</p>

<p>Marketing works to drive folks to their website and offerings through content, or advertising, or social media posting.</p>

<p>Once those visitors land on the site, in order to turn them into sales leads, they need to be identified.</p>

<p>One way to do this is through what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;gated&rdquo; content - things like ebooks, reports, templates and such that require a visitor to leave an email address and various other data to get access to the content.</p>

<p>The other way is to try and tease out who the visitor is using things like third-party cookies or their ip address to try and unmask them to one degree or another.</p>

<p>Then you can reach out to these companies to try and set up a proper sales call.</p>

<p>In addition to these first-party sources of leads, there also exists a universe of third-party &ldquo;intent&rdquo; offerings that can be used to build lists for sales teams to try and do cold outreach to, or to power Account Based Marketing (ABM) programs of advertising.</p>

<p>These platforms - <a href="https://bombora.com/">Bombora</a>, <a href="https://6sense.com/">6Sense</a>, <a href="https://www.demandbase.com/">Demandbase</a>, etc - do the same anonymous identification I mentioned earlier, trying to tie an anonymous visitor to a company. Then they look at the pages or sites they&rsquo;re visiting and attach that visit to various terms or keywords.</p>

<p>And they can also tie the company identification to lots of sources of company firmographic (location, size, revenue, etc) data to filter lists of companies by.</p>

<p>So, they can make it so you can say things like &ldquo;Show me all the companies with revenue above $50 Million in San Fransisco that have looked at pages about content distribution&rdquo; and then you can hand that list of companies to your cold-calling/emailing team (typically called Sales or Business Development Representatives) or use them for advertising targeting using platforms like <a href="https://terminus.com/">Terminus</a>.</p>

<p>Many of these intent platforms will also calculate things like &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; or &ldquo;surges&rdquo; which are intended to indicate a change in the consumption of things about these topics.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-with-intent">The problems with intent</h2>

<p>Now that we have the background out of the way, here&rsquo;s some of the ways this can go wrong.</p>

<p>A lot of the data sources behind this are shared between providers. They&rsquo;re all essentially using the same blocks of ip addresses and the same wells of third-party cookies and drawing intent from the same set of media partners and the like.</p>

<p>For the company identification, they&rsquo;re making guesses based on various probabilistic algorithms across all these different data sources. Sometimes these guesses are really good! Sometimes, they are very wrong.</p>

<p>These guesses got a lot worse once the pandemic hit and everybody started working from home and were no longer tied to corporate networks in many cases. Additionally, a lot of internet usage is done through personal email logins rather than business email logins, so many of these sources have your gmail address and not your bigco.com email email address. These platforms and providers have to build bridges between those.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s before you get into coffee shops and working spaces and VPNs that muddy the IP data even more.</p>

<p>Finally, the third-party cookie data is also increasingly shrinking in relevance. Those cookies only work in Google Chrome these days and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/goodbye-third-party-cookies/">won&rsquo;t for much longer</a>.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re targeting advertising off of this data, it&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re wasting some of your advertising budget, but nobody gets all that upset about it. It&rsquo;s weird when you see a LinkedIn advertisement for something that isn&rsquo;t a great fit for you, but most folks don&rsquo;t think much about it.</p>

<p>The problem you run into - and many of these platforms are starting to run into this problem now as many of their customers look for software subscriptions that they can cut - is when you hand this same data over to your sales team.</p>

<p>Once your sales team is calling or emailing folks cold from them visiting your site or their showing some level of &ldquo;intent&rdquo; about some topic or another, that can be a different story. One or two misses of identification and many sales users of these platforms write off the entire endeavor.</p>

<p>If you clicked through that LinkedIn post earlier, he mentions that he&rsquo;s talked to customers of these platforms and didn&rsquo;t find anybody all that excited about them. That&rsquo;s largely feedback from sales teams which have likely been burned repeatedly by either bad account identification <em>or</em> flaky levels of &ldquo;intent&rdquo; being shown (where one or two page visits might be enough to &ldquo;spike&rdquo;).</p>

<p>As a final bit of foreshadowing, this is all hazy and sketchy at the <em>company</em> level of the data. I&rsquo;ve looked at them and spot-checked a lot of them - they&rsquo;re bad and inaccurate about the company identification everywhere. And if they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re extremely limited to company-owned IP addresses and sure-fire identities meaning you have lots of holes and not a lot of useful data to work with - quality, but no quantity.</p>

<p>When I cross-compared many of these services for company identification against things like internal signals, the best match rates I found was less than a coin flip for accuracy. Maybe they&rsquo;ve gotten better in the last couple of years - but the world&rsquo;s been making it harder for them, not easier.</p>

<h2 id="getting-personal">Getting personal</h2>

<p>That linked LinkedIn post earlier also mentions launching a new thing that doesn&rsquo;t just identify the <em>company</em> making a visit or showing intent, but the <em>individual</em> doing so.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked with a <em>lot</em> of lawyers in my previous role &hellip; and that&rsquo;s not going to fly if you&rsquo;re doing any business or seeing any visitors from Europe - or California.</p>

<p>Privacy laws such as <a href="https://www.cookieyes.com/blog/ccpa-vs-gdpr/">GDPR and CCPA</a> mean you&rsquo;re taking on a lot of legal liability when you start tying together personally identifiable information (PII). Even the company level identification we&rsquo;ve been talking about so far often involves sweet-talking lawyers to get things across the line.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go down the PII rabbit hole and try to uncover the precise individual doing activities, you&rsquo;re inviting a boatload of lawyerly attention the second you get big enough for them to care.</p>

<p>Not that I think you would!</p>

<p>Because, as mentioned earlier - the folks who want the individual level are <em>sales</em> users. Everybody wants the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/">Glengarry</a> leads, after all.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s company-level intent providers are already struggling with coverage, misidentification, and eroding trust.</p>

<p>Now imagine you try to figure out who exactly at those companies are making this activity. And imagine some Sales Development Representative somewhere fires off an AI-generated cold email outreach or picks up the phone and gives them a ring before they get ahold of somebody that doesn&rsquo;t match.</p>

<p>How long do you think they&rsquo;ll keep doing that?</p>

<p>How many times do they get wrong numbers, angry people, and coffeeshop strangers before they stop using it entirely?</p>

<p>From my experience, that number is quite low &hellip; and my educated guess is any service trying to dig out individuals is either going to trigger that experience frequently - or, if they lean into ironclad identification, there&rsquo;s not enough meat on the bone to be valuable.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all before the lawyers get hold of you!</p>

<p>Godspeed, my dude, and good luck - you&rsquo;ll need heaping amounts of both.</p>

<h2 id="wait-so-what-should-i-do">Wait. So, what should I do?</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a consumer like me and want to opt out of this world as best you can, use something other than Chrome, turn off third-party cookies, run a VPN and laugh.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a marketer using one of these platforms, check with your sales teams and see how they&rsquo;re finding the accuracy suits them. If they&rsquo;re happy with what these platforms are unearthing, keep going! I&rsquo;m not suggesting you stop doing stuff you and your team think are working!</p>

<p>If they&rsquo;re not happy, though, it might be time to try a different approach to marketing. Identify your audience, talk to them, be curious, try to be helpful! Don&rsquo;t go looking for &ldquo;intent&rdquo;, look for ways you can be helpful and honestly help people. And then marry that with intent sources that are in your control - gated form fills, newsletter subscribers, social media followers (well, less this bucket), that sort of thing.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s me. Typing this behind a VPN &hellip;</p>

<p>Stay safe out there, folks!</p>

<p>As part of this Twelve Days of Christmas Cookies shenanigans I’m undertaking, I occasionally slip in a family recipe.</p>

<p>In this case, these chocolate cookies have a Hershey’s Kiss in the middle and were one my favorites growing up - though dangerous because they looked very similar to another cookie that had a cherry in the middle (yuck!).</p>

<p>These require a bit more work than most of the cookies I’ve been making, but are still mighty tasty.</p>

<h2 id="cocoa-kisses">Cocoa Kisses</h2>

<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
<li>Two sticks of salted butter*</li>
<li>2/3 cup of granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>&frac14; cup cocoa powder</li>
<li>1 cup finely chopped pecans</li>
<li>1 package Hershey’s Kisses</li>
<li>Confectioners sugar for coating</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="method">Method</h4>

<p>Cream together the butter, sugar and vanilla.</p>

<p>Mix together the flour and cocoa.</p>

<p>Add to creamed butter.</p>

<p>Slowly mix in pecans.</p>

<p>Let the dough chill in the fridge for one hour or so.</p>

<p>Scoop out ~a tablespoon of dough, flatten it out and wrap completely around a kiss candy.</p>

<p>Shape into a ball and place on an ungreased cookie sheet. They don’t spread much, so you don’t need a lot of space between.</p>

<p>Bake at 375 Fahrenheit for 10-12 minutes.</p>

<p>Let cool slightly and move to a wire rack. Let cool completely before rolling in or dusting with confectioners sugar.</p>

<ul>
<li>- If you only have unsalted butter, throw in a &frac12; teaspoon of table salt. If you have espresso powder handy, a pinch of that doesn’t hurt, either.</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of The Twelve Days of Christmas Cookies thing I’m doing, I’m mixing in a few family recipes.</p>

<p>This is our version of Mexican Wedding Cookies.</p>

<p>I always remembered them as being the one green cookie we made each year - though they don’t taste anything like green. It’s just food coloring after all.</p>

<p>In doing a bit of research on the name, this is a style of cookies originally called Russian Tea Cakes, but the name changed (and splintered) in the post-WWII Cold War period.</p>

<li>1 cup finely chopped pecans (or other nuts)</li>
<li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
<li>Confectioners sugar for rolling post-bake</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="method">Method</h4>

<p>Preheat oven to 325 Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Cream together the butter and sugar.</p>

<p>If you’re new to cookie baking: “creaming” means beating the butter and sugar together until it gets kind of light and fluffy. A mixer of some sort makes easy work of it, but you can break out a wooden spoon and make it happen eventually.</p>

<p>Add the vanilla and a bit of green food coloring.</p>

<p>Mix in the flour and chopped nut meats.</p>

<p>Roll the dough into 1-inch balls (a cookie scoop really helps standardize things).</p>

<p>Bake on a ungreased cookie sheet 18-20 minutes. They don’t spread much, so you only need an inch or so between them.</p>

<p>Let the cool for a few minutes before rolling in confectioners sugar while still warm.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As a kid, we visited Civil War battlefields like some folks hunt Pokémon. We stopped at the ones along the way, and the ones that were a bit out of the way.</p>

<p>We did the Shenandoah Valley, all four near Fredericksburg (Federicksburg, The Wildness, Spotsylvania Courthouse, and Chancellorsville), Shiloh, Vicksburg, Brice&rsquo;s Crossroads, Antietam and any others which we ran or planned across.</p>

<p>My Dad subscribed to Civil War Illustrated. Ken Burns &ldquo;Civil War&rdquo; series was a hit on PBS.</p>

<p>I ate the stuff up and to this day can name generals on both sides at various battles and engagements and whatnot.</p>

<p>The big kahuna, though, was always Gettysburg - the high water mark of the Confederacy and a huge, sprawling three day engagement across Pennsylvania peach orchards, wheat fields, round top hills, and dens of devils.</p>

<p>I remember going as a kid and doing the tour - I can&rsquo;t recall if guided or self-directed - and stopping at every monument and plaque and reading every stitch.</p>

<p>I remember it all pretty fondly - in case you couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<p>Earlier today (note: I wrote this on June 19, 2023), I took my kids to Gettysburg.</p>

<p>And I left feeling differently - or maybe I arrived thinking differently and the experience reinforced it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a new visitors center now - all shiny and corporate. It feels like there&rsquo;s more knickknacks in the gift shop (which feels huge compared to other national park service properties). There are tour companies out the wazoo - the helpful ticket lady could get you a private one if you wanted. There&rsquo;s an efficient two theater system to churn visitors through the Morgan Freeman-voiced film and into the Cyclorama - a 360-degree painting that&rsquo;s been there for a hundred years or so, now gussied up and in a custom-built theater.</p>

<p>This is all kind of expected from any of the National Parks big hitters. We&rsquo;re heading to Independence Hall tomorrow and I kind of expect the same.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t match the shabbiness and livedinedness of my memory. The Gettysburg battlefield in my head is more DIY, more bespoke, more haunting than it is Haunted Mansion (author note: I adore Haunted Mansion - just not here).</p>

<p>Some of that is probably the old man growing inside my 40+ year old frame. Kids today and all that.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;d like to talk about more is how I view things - like the Civil War itself - differently these days.</p>

<p>I grew up in an era and region that mythologized Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson more than a little. Reluctant fighters for their native state alongside their fellow Virginians. We never talked about their slaves or their horrifically racist views. Lee was a kindly gentleman - hell, he had half a college named for him! And Jackson to this day has a state park named after him in my (and his) native state of West Virginia.</p>

<p>And the start of the self-guided car tour at Gettysburg shortly gets into row after after row of monuments to men like these - men fighting against their government not for their states, but for the continued legal ability to own other people as property - and to continue to expand that ability to new territories forevermore.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to look at their monuments. I didn&rsquo;t want to look at the statues of Lee, or for the boys of North Carolina or Mississippi or Louisiana. And I didn&rsquo;t want to get photos of my kids next to them either. I don&rsquo;t want to gaze upon these monuments to their rightfully lost cause of human suffering into perpetuity.</p>

			 <p>I began running on a whim - running between electrical poles.</p>

<p>I ran in rain, cold, with knee pain, through therapy for that knee, and everything else before running my first 5k this morning.</p>

<p>Each time, I take a selfie when the run is done.</p>

<p>This is first and last of those.</p>

<p>Think I’ll keep doing this.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been trying to get three runs - still kind of walk/runs for now - a week.</p>

<p>First this week was rainy. I went anyway, and did 2-1 run/walk (best ratio yet).</p>

<p>This morning was <em>cold</em>, but I went anyway. I went longer, still 2-1 for 3.75k … still building for a 5k in April/May.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of the more powerful things I do at my new job is at the end of the week I update a running document I call “Shipping Department News”, which is a list of all the stuff we deployed to production in the week.</p>

<p>It’s a bulleted list, and each item has a little description of what it does and why it matters.</p>

<p>Sometimes, there’s a screenshot or two or a humorous aside.</p>

<p>There are also a section with status and planning updates for upcoming stuff.</p>

<p>This document takes me 15 minutes or so each week to update, but it has so many benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don’t have to bog down meetings with a lot of project status updates, since that’s all in the document</li>
<li>When we do an external product update, we have an easy review of what we’ve deployed lately that can feed our narrative</li>
<li>It emphasizes momentum and helps keep the company aligned on our direction</li>
</ul>

<p>I mention all this because it’s a neat work idea you should totally steal if you’re in a similar engineering/product leadership sort of role, obviously. I&rsquo;ve gone back to this approach four times in my career and it has <em>killed</em> each time.</p>

<p>But I also mention it because as I sit at my home office desk and reflect on the week, I’m thinking about stealing this idea for my own life.</p>

<p>I already journal each day - one daily page with a schedule and todos, and another running journal which I start my day with what I’m grateful for and end it with the three big wins (aside: I should talk more about what that looks like someday soon, too) - but am thinking about a similar weekly wrap for my life.</p>

<p>This week, for instance, would be something like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Appeared on a podcast for work:</strong> This is the first podcasting thing I’ve done in close to (if not more than) a decade. And it <a href="https://www.thejuicehq.com/blog/modern-day-marketer-why-were-hosting-product-roadmap-live-with-chris-vannoy">turned out great</a>, and I found it more fun than I remembered. It&rsquo;s something I might try to do more of.</li>
<li><strong>Led a product webinar at work:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been watching other folks give roadmap reviews for several years now, and had a great time <a href="https://thejuice.registration.goldcast.io/events/699bfbb2-30c1-46df-b8e1-154c474df5ef">hosting one myself</a> this week (I might find a non-gated version of that down the road).</li>
<li><strong>Dropped below 275 pounds:</strong> I&rsquo;m down ~25 pounds since early November and it&rsquo;s felt sustainable along the way. Bounced back up slightly after that low, but it&rsquo;ll come around again.</li>
<li><strong>Started constantly running:</strong> The week before, I started running a few times a week - just running between every other utility pole for now - but I kept at this it week. My last run was the first one where I wasn&rsquo;t maxing out my heart rate the whole time. This week, I also got a goal of running a 5K in May lodged in my head.</li>
<li><strong>Had lunch out with my wife twice:</strong> Once for Valentines Day and once again today.</li>
<li><strong>Got a janky part of our fence fixed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Replaced a busted bathroom faucet on my own</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finally made it back to my weekly trivia night</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stayed out entirely too late last night to go see Ant-Man</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I won&rsquo;t always share this sort of update publicly - perhaps never again. But I&rsquo;m also willing to bet some day in the future I&rsquo;ll come back to this entry and read this and smile.</p>

<p>Not every week will be this good, either.</p>

<p>But I think this week is the one that will start the string. Once a week, writing down the big things that happened in my life - so I can remember, stay aligned, and emphasize my own momentum.</p>

<p>Hope you&rsquo;re having a fabulous Friday (or whatever day it is when you happen to read this) out there.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/2022/12/30/favorite-places-for.html">Favorite places for nature very near Indianapolis</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/2022/12/30/favorite-places-for.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-12-30 14:29:13 -0500">Dec 30, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I read a blog post recently by a fellow resident of Indianapolis who&rsquo;s having a hard time lately and found themselves lamenting the lack of places for <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/07/17/536676954/forest-bathing-a-retreat-to-nature-can-boost-immunity-and-mood">&ldquo;Forest bathing&rdquo;</a> in Indianapolis (and cities like it).</p>

<p>It seemed familiar to me - as one of the ways I reset myself often is to go for a walk in the woods. Sometimes I go far afield - down to <a href="https://www.in.gov/dnr/state-parks/parks-lakes/brown-county-state-park/">Brown County</a>, or many a Indiana state park.</p>

<p>But more often, I stick around home.</p>

<p>So to help my internet friend out (should they ever see this), and to put a positive spin on things, here are places in and around Indianapolis that I&rsquo;ve been able to find a quiet spot, sit a spell and look at trees.</p>

<p>In rough order of recommendation:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.in.gov/dnr/state-parks/parks-lakes/fort-harrison-state-park/">Fort Harrison State Park</a>:</strong> A former military installation and World War II prisoner of war camp, this state park over in the Lawrence corner of Marion County features a handful of trails. For the best shot at solitude, take the Fall Creek Trail and alight on a bench along the steps up the bluffs next to Fall Creek, or pick a bench on the Camp Creek Trail. There are longer trails at the park, but these two are absent mountain bikers. There is an entrance fee, like all Indiana State Parks (a grumble for another day), but if you live in Indy, the $50 annual pass pays for itself in no time. Oh, and if you look around a bit, you can probably find back entrances to the park to skip the fee entirely - the best one is near the intersection of Fall Creek and Boy Scout Road.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.hollidaypark.org/">Holliday Park</a>:</strong> There&rsquo;s a surprisingly gnarled set of short trails in this park alongside the White River west of Broad Ripple. Difficult to get a long hike in, but there are spots near the river that are tricky to get in or out of where you can grab a few minutes of peace (before grinding your way back uphill).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/ritchey-woods/">Ritchie Woods Nature Preserve</a>:</strong> Our first foray out of Marion County - but barely. Just north of 96th Street and off Hauge Road, this small Fishers park has a small network of trails. Wandering off to the trails rightward into the woods will get you off the beaten path pretty quickly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://historicindianapolis.com/in-the-park-skiles-test-nature-park/">Skiles Test Nature Park</a>:</strong> Another patch of woods. This one has a primary path running through it (which connects to the Fall Creek Greenway &hellip; and then to that back entrance to Fort Ben I mentioned), and also a slew of spurs off and into the woods proper.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are more than those four. But those are my four go-tos when I need to get out into nature for a bit.</p>

<p>Always interested in learning new places, too!</p>

<ul>
<li>Shipped new code to prod</li>
<li>Finished a draft of our roadmap</li>

<p>In ye olde days, coding bootcamps were cranking out junior Rubyists like crazy.</p>

<p>That custom report is generated by magic dwarves. To ensure they produce at the quality we and our customers expect, we keep them supplied with medical-grade peyote.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the week you requested this report, they had run out of their supply, and given global supply chain issues, we were delayed in getting them their needed hallucinogens. This resulted in an obvious dip in report accuracy and quality accordingly.</p>

<p>We have apologized to them (they were quite upset, as dwarves are wont) and now we must also apologize to you as well.</p>

<p>Given these magic elves are now on the proper plane of consciousness, I’ve asked them to rerun the reports.</p>

<p>I’ll report back when they’ve finished and hopefully we’ll see results more in line with your expectations.</p>

<p>Luckily, I already have had a home over at <a href="https://micro.blog/v">micro.blog/v</a> for a while now. And posts start there.</p>

<p>I miss yinz, though. If you&rsquo;re also on Micro (or Mastadon or something), let me know.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Toward the end of 2021, I started itching for a way to get out of the house and do some good.</p>

<p>Over the course of the current pandemic, I got more and more into home cooking and found that time spent in the kitchen - even doing prep work - really gave me a considerable peace of mind, so I figured I&rsquo;d concentrate on ways I could do more of that and help others while I was at it.</p>

<p>After poking around at various charity organization listing sites - aside: most of these are truly dreadful for finding volunteer opportunities - I remembered an organization I&rsquo;d already give money to - Second Helpings.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.secondhelpings.org/">Second Helpings</a> is a food rescue, hunger relief, and culinary training organization here in Indianapolis. They currently transform more than 300,000 pounds of rescued food into around 150,000 meals each month. These meals are then delivered to partner charitable organizations that get the meals to those that need them.</p>

<p>I had donated money in the past and was vaguely aware of them through donation drives run by <a href="https://www.indyhackers.org/">IndyHackers</a> as part of their yearly Holiday Social.</p>

<p>So, I signed up to volunteer, went through some training and have made it in twice now to help out. One time doing meat chopping and another making sandwiches.</p>

<p>Below are some thoughts and tips from the experience so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>They run a really good onboarding program that involves a zoom call, filling out a few forms, and a quick tour on your first shift.</li>
<li>You sign up for four-hour shifts across a number of different functions. Everything from offloading donated goods, to handling reception, to chopping meat or stirring pots.</li>
<li>Of the two jobs I&rsquo;ve done so far, sandwich making is a far tougher job than meat chopping. Even if meat chopping involved a slight cut on my thumb and a nice callous on my knuckle where the knife rested. There&rsquo;s way more steps to making sandwiches than you might think.</li>
<li>There are two entrances: One in the front of the building and one in the back near where you park. As a volunteer, you want to buzz in through the back door.</li>
<li>Right now, everybody&rsquo;s wearing masks, and everyone supplies proof of vaccination, so it feels pretty safe all things considered from a pandemic standpoint.</li>
<li>You register for a time slot and job to do using online software, and then sign in to that software once there so they can track hours worked and such - likely useful if you, say, have a certain number of service hours you need to reach, but handy to keep a running tally for yourself regardless.</li>
<li>Knives, aprons, gloves, etc are all provided &hellip; just bring yourself at your volunteered for time and job and you&rsquo;ll have what you need.</li>
<li>You have to wear closed-toe shoes, and a hat or hair net &hellip; and a chin net of some sort if you&rsquo;re rocking a beard. This is actually one reason I started shaving again recently.</li>
<li>Everybody has been extremely helpful, which I suppose is expected from a volunteer organization. But folks have gone out of their way to help me figure out, for instance, what all those steps are for making a sandwich and prepping it for delivery.</li>
<li>No headphones, either. But they do play music and folks talk while they work. It&rsquo;s a fun, focused sort of atmosphere.</li>
<li>The food you&rsquo;ll be making or preparing is almost like an episode of Chopped. The menu gets determined by what&rsquo;s been donated that week.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m decidedly on the young side of the volunteer base. Most volunteers I&rsquo;ve met do so during their retirement years.</li>
<li>This is among the first active volunteer work I&rsquo;ve done as an adult. In college, I spent time helping with disaster recovery a time or two, but since then life&rsquo;s been busy or at least distracted. I underestimated and/or forgot how good it would feel to do this sort of work. It&rsquo;s physical labor for a few hours, but the drive home from just east of downtown Indy (near where Angie&rsquo;s List used to be) I&rsquo;m smiling the whole time. And then I start scheming for when I get away from work again to go spent another shift - I might trying unloading and sorting food donations next time.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you can find walking into an unknown social situation a little unnerving - even with a good onboarding program like Second Helpings has.</p>

<p>I hope this little peek into things helps make it a little less unknown for you, and I&rsquo;d encourage you to join me chopping veggies, or unloading boxes, or dropping off sandwiches.</p>

<p>If not at Second Helpings, then somewhere else - or somewhere similar in your neck of the woods.</p>

<p>If it is at Second Helpings, <a href="https://www.secondhelpings.org/volunteer/">go sign up</a>! Maybe we can coordinate a shift or something.</p>

			 <p>I wrote the below yesterday, planning to post it today.</p>

<p>Over the course of driving back to Indy today, it gave me pause, though.</p>

<p>I mean, for all the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have fancy stuff&rdquo; below, I am inherently a privileged, and fairly &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; person. I mean, I grind my own coffee and use an aeropress. I drive a friggin&rsquo; Prius (as unfancy as I might find it below).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been really lucky in my life to have what are actually a lot of &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; things beyond a roof over my head, a bed to sleep in and enough food to not be hungry.</p>

<p>And there are many among us - some likely very near where I live - that don&rsquo;t even have those necessities, let alone all my fancy things I don&rsquo;t find all that &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; below.</p>

<p>Anyway. Here&rsquo;s my fancy ass complaining about not having fancy things.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>Over the New Year&rsquo;s break, a question entered my head:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fanciest thing I have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It came up in reference to a new car for some friends of ours, but for my own little family unit, it&rsquo;s a trickier than I expected question.</p>

<p>In thinking about it, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of fancy things.</p>

<p>Our house we bought off a foreclosure and the bottom end of the market. It&rsquo;s fine, but certainly not fancy.  We haven&rsquo;t done much since to make it fancy, either - maybe the built-in bookshelves my Dad helped us build shortly after we bought it more than a decade ago?</p>

<p>Our cars - a Toyota Prius V and a Honda Fit - are bought to be practical, not fancy. Maybe the vegan leather seats in the Prius are kinda fancy? But not by the time we bought it used several years into its life.</p>

<p>Most of our furniture we bought before we had kids - and kids have happened to most of our furniture. But we knew that would happen, and they&rsquo;re not fancy.</p>

<p>Our largest TV - new this Christmas - is a budget model with a hardware defect along the right side. That doesn&rsquo;t seem fancy. Picture&rsquo;s nice, though.</p>

<p>My work desk has a monitor arm on it - that&rsquo;s kind of fancy I guess, even if it fell off the back of a truck, so to speak.</p>

<p>Could my fanciest thing be my desk chair? A Steelcase Leap I bought used years ago when I gave consulting a try? Maybe that.</p>

<p>For my birthday, my wife got me a Tom Bihn Co-Pilot bag. Tom Bihn&rsquo;s fancy stuff, right? Feels kinda fancy at least.</p>

<p>Anyway &hellip; As I got the end of thinking of this, I asked myself another question: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we have fancy stuff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I answered:</p>

<p>Because we&rsquo;d rather do fancy things instead.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>Ok. That out of the way, tomorrow I&rsquo;ll tell you about how - if you&rsquo;re located around Central Indiana - you can volunteer at <a href="https://www.secondhelpings.org/">Second Helpings</a>, a food rescue and hunger relief organization in Indianapolis, and what that&rsquo;s like.</p>

			 <p>It’s 2022 today, and Happy New Year to you and yours.</p>

<p>The year past was at a macro level, a bit of a hellscape, but at a micro/personal level, far rosier.</p>

<p>We managed to travel safely - around Indiana, to a relatively secluded beach, a weekend in Chicago, and then NYC/Boston. I switched from Engineering to Product at work. I found a thing I believe in to work on on the side. I started regular therapy.</p>

<p>I enter the new year in a pretty positive place - with goals defined long ago, clear plans to get to those goals, and a new sense of self gained over the last year.</p>

<p>I’m excited - and not afraid to admit that.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here’s some bits I learned along the way in 2021:</p>

<ol>
<li>I like hiking - mostly fairly flat stuff for now</li>
<li>A daily walk is a key part of maintaining my mental health</li>
<li>Therapy isn&rsquo;t as scary as I thought</li>
<li>I can live without Slack - and many other things - on my phone</li>
<li><a href="https://www.outdoorresearch.com/us/">Outdoor Research</a> tends to make things I like and that fit me</li>
<li>Adding a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/dining/perfect-scrambled-eggs.html">tiny bit of cornstarch</a> to the eggs makes it way harder to overcook scrambled eggs</li>
<li>I spend entirely too much time on my phone</li>
<li>Getting a passport is easier than I expected - and feels pretty liberating, too</li>
<li>Michigan State fans are good people, and their stadium experience is the most cult-like I&rsquo;ve been to yet</li>
<li>An <a href="https://stores.innsgifts.com/2022-annual-state-park-entrance-permit/">Indiana State Park pass</a> is a great value - even if it remains deeply strange that the state charges entrance fees for its parks</li>
<li>Kentucky University football really likes to pretend the University of Louisville doesn&rsquo;t exist</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indianapolissymphony.org/events/season-subscribe/series/yuletide/">Yuletide</a> is a really great holiday tradition we&rsquo;ll probably keep up from now on</li>
<li>Throwing leftover chili, some cheese and whatnot on a baked potato is a surprisingly great lunch</li>
<li>$1.50/slice pizza from a <a href="https://www.2brospizza.com/">hole in the wall pizza joint</a> in NYC is <em>miles</em> better than the fancy-ass pizza you get from the <a href="https://www.eataly.com/us_en/">Upscale Italian grocery store</a> elsewhere in Manhattan.</li>
<li>Takeout Chicago-style pizza <em>really</em> needs to be held level on the way home to keep stuff from sliding around and off the pie</li>
<li>Always have a spare battery, a lightning cable and a way to charge my Apple Watch when traveling - stuff goes dead and I&rsquo;m toast without</li>
<li>Walking tours are almost always worth the investment</li>
<li>The cash you save by staying in the outskirts is outweighed by the time you lose in transit - the costs likely even out anyway</li>
<li>A late snow - when you get it on early spring greenery - makes for a beautiful scene and hike</li>
<li>Sous vide makes a beef roast really easy and pretty cost-effective (since you can use a cheaper cut and still get tasty outcomes)</li>
<li>Backpacking is fun - but difficult to pull off without feeling guilty about leaving my family behind</li>
<li>Despite years of avoiding it and being a generally scruffy-looking guy, I actually like shaving regularly</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really not much of a beach person</li>
<li>Or a pool person</li>
<li>I can make bread!</li>
<li>I like cooking for other people</li>
<li>I can make pasta!</li>
<li>Illinois football doesn&rsquo;t take itself too seriously - which is fun as a spectator</li>
<li>Northwestern football - and Ryan Field in particular - feels like a time warp</li>
<li>Public transportation makes travel way more fun</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t over schedule said travel. You&rsquo;ll end up buying tickets for things you don&rsquo;t go to</li>
<li>Merino wool can be a bit pricey, but being able to pack less stuff makes it worth it</li>
<li>I feel better about myself if I take just a few minutes each evening to wash my face before bed</li>
<li>Having a bunch of cheap deli containers around the kitchen are really handy - and space-efficient in the fridge</li>
<li>A grill basket really makes grilling various veggies way easier</li>
<li>Homemade barbecue sauce isn&rsquo;t that difficult to pull off</li>
<li>I like wearing sandals more than I would have thought</li>
<li>I can replace the hardware on a dishwasher rack - and it&rsquo;s way cheaper than a new dishwasher</li>
<li>Zero drop shoes cause immediate and massive blisters for me</li>
<li>Having open and honest conversations at work can sometimes get you closer to what you want</li>
<li>Actually thinking about what you want also gets you closer to what you want</li>
<li>Prioritizing general things or themes - the big stuff - also helps</li>
<li>Saying no and turning things off leaves room for some of that stuff you prioritized</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve prioritized something and it&rsquo;s still not progressing, maybe rethink your priorities or your approach. Or take smaller bites</li>
<li>Little things done regularly have compounding value</li>
<li>After buying many different ones over the years, it&rsquo;s time to admit that todo apps don&rsquo;t work for me</li>
<li>My inner voice thinks I&rsquo;m probably wrong, but in reality, I&rsquo;m usually right</li>
<li>Many things that say they are pest or rodent proof probably aren&rsquo;t</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a great - and mostly free - <a href="https://gwcri.com/">electronics recycling place on Shadeland</a></li>
<li>Nobody knows what they&rsquo;re doing - including me</li>
<li>Everybody is struggling in their own way</li>
<li>Tomorrow can always be better than yesterday - but it might need a little push (it’s ok to not feel like pushing some days)</li>

<p>I grew up in my home state of West Virginia around college football.</p>

<p>Each fall was spent either listening to the Mountaineers on hunting trips or traveling up to Morgantown for games.</p>

<p>After a while, I started going to road games as well here and there.</p>

<p>Later on, I started my career in sports departments of small West Virginia newspapers in Parkersburg and Clarksburg - eventually covering Marshall when Byron Leftwich was their quarterback.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had that base of things in my life, when a few years ago, I got this notion of wanting to see a home game at every FBS college team.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m up to 18 (of 130), and am knocking off a handful each year until my kids go off to start their adult lives and/or I retire some day in the future.</p>

<p>From now on, I&rsquo;ll post more detailed things along the way, but I figured I&rsquo;d load up the current list and state of things.</p>

<p>Buffalo in late November is quite possibly the ideal state for this visit to a tiny stadium tucked away in a mostly residential area.</p>

<p>Able to witness a nearly empty stadium, some light snowflakes, and a <em>huge</em> day from Buffalo running back Jaret Patterson.</p>

<p>Biggest oddity, though, was the lack of a halftime show of any sort &hellip; and there was a band there (as you can see in the first photo).</p>

<p>Good coffee, though.</p>

<p>The second stop of a double-header day (more below on the visit to Vanderbilt earlier in the day), WKU reminded me most of games I&rsquo;d attended at Marshall - just red instead of green.</p>

<p>One of the few times since I&rsquo;ve committed to this quest that I didn&rsquo;t pick up a hat - I couldn&rsquo;t find an in-stadium merch store. All I have from here are photos, a themed game day t-shirt, and a long-digested belly of <a href="https://cookout.com/">Cook Out</a> for dinner beforehand.</p>

<p>Ended up driving home to Indianapolis around halftime - rolling into my driveway near midnight.</p>

<p>Woke up and started my day with a drive down to Nashville - about four hours south of my home in Indianapolis - in tiem for this noon kickoff.</p>

<p>Vandy might be the weirdest of my trips so far (well, perhaps tied to Buffalo). It&rsquo;s a strange atmosphere mix of SEC money, MAC enthusiasm, and an urban campus. Huge production/scoreboard, announcers and the like and a very &ldquo;meh&rdquo; crowd reaction throughout.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t help that the home team struggled mightily with a middle of the pack MAC team.</p>

<p>As I mentioned up the caption, as a WVU fan, this game <em>sucked</em>. We went in ranked #6 in the country and got positively pantsed.</p>

<p>As part of The Quest, though, this was probably the best-case scenario for seeing a night game in Ames.</p>

<p>I joined <a href="https://techpoint.org/tech-directory/sigstr/">Sigstr</a> fairly early on its journey, and for the first time, I was at a place early enough to help set the philosophy and direction of the engineering group.</p>

<p>We had a <a href="https://twitter.com/ilaunchtech">VP at the time</a> who was very big on <em>principles</em>, and forced us to stop and think about them from time to time.</p>

<p>Looking back, those principles I helped set and wrote down are one of the prouder moments of my career.</p>

<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t have done this with Robert&rsquo;s guidance and push.</p>

<p>These principles also accurately reflect where we were at Sigstr at the time - geared around speed of delivery, experimentation, and trying to build a learning culture.</p>

<p>I also remember some painful scars around a few of these principles &hellip;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wrote down at the time, feel free to use it yourself.</p>

<p>I fully intend to copy-and-paste it as a starter kit should I be in that position again.</p>

<h3 id="team-engineering-principles">Team Engineering Principles</h3>

<p><em>This is a living document. More will be added over time. <em>Last updated:</em> 8/27/18</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Prefer boring over novel or clever.</li>
<li>Assume code is broken until proven otherwise.</li>
<li>Assume all input is malicious.</li>
<li>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.</li>
<li>When choosing a technology, pick the one you&rsquo;re most comfortable with delivering business value in a timely fashion. When in doubt, or when needing to break tie, pick ones that more than one person on the team knows.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t write your own logger. Concentrate on building things that deliver core business value and rely on libraries and third parties for commodity items as much as possible.</li>
<li>Everything should be able to be rolled back - whether through API versions, or more regularly, through feature flagging.</li>
<li>Once code has been reviewed, it is every team member&rsquo;s job to get that code deployed into production as fast as possible.</li>
<li>Smaller is better - in tickets, in pull requests, in deployments, in services (maybe: Use bounded contexts and #team-platform principles as your guide here).</li>
<li>Smaller, more frequent deploys are encouraged.</li>
<li>One way or another, you&rsquo;re going to be testing your code - either manually locally, in staging and in production, or through automated tests. It&rsquo;s better for everybody involved - you, your coworkers, the business, our customers - if that testing is automated.</li>
<li>That said, automated tests do not replace actual confirmation that our work is correct.</li>
<li>Related to the above, when fixing a bug, write a failing test case first.</li>
<li>What we hand off to QA or UAT or customers is - to the best of our knowledge and efforts to confirm - correct and ready to be in production.</li>
<li>If a PR has no tests, a reviewer has every right to reject said PR at their discretion.</li>
<li>Work with empathy - for your coworkers, for your future self and for our customers.</li>
<li>First you make it work, then you make it fast, then you make it pretty.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a year or more now, @alfredapp (which I love) hasn’t been finding stock apps like “Music” when I use it.</p>

<p>It’s annoyed me for that long. A little frown every time I exit out of the search box and Shift-Command-A to open up the Applications folder to select the app I want <em>like an animal</em>.</p>

<p>Today, I finally google it, check the top result, read their excellent docs, realize my Alfred’s out of date, upgrade it.</p>

			 <p>CLASSIFIED. TOP SECRET CLEARANCE REQUIRED.</p>

<p>I suspect our time here at Station Alpha is limited. Our few vegetables - bagged lettuce and a pair of tomatoes - are beginning to turn, and by the time the night&rsquo;s out our strategic rum reserve will run dry, as well as our stocks of American beer. Eggs we&rsquo;re still good on, but ham is running low. I also managed to secret two slices of bread - wheat - from the communal stocks this morning.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve arranged for a major resupply tomorrow - calculated to be enough to carry us through the end of the mission, but lacking in beverage stores.</p>

<p>The landlord has begun asking questions. It will be curious to see how this shakes out tomorrow - an important day for the work.</p>

<p>Plans for today came into focus when the call came to communicate with our Irish forces up north. I took the back way there to ensure I wasn&rsquo;t tailed - through Omega and Windfall before hitting Kokomo and then passing by the boys at Grissom.</p>

<p>Once at our agreed rendezvous point, I found the area largely deserted and the doors locked shut. I did a circuit for reconnaissance purposes - recon photos attached. I spoke with no one and drew no attention to myself; I didn&rsquo;t even try a door knob. Notices announcing closures were on many of the doors.</p>

<p>Fearing the no-show was a cover for an incursion into Station Alpha, I initiated a burn back to the stations after completing the circuit. The drive was largely desolate and befitting these apocalyptic times.</p>

<p>Agent Hulu briefly came through today, and I was also able to help coordinate a few things with Agent Purple on the homefront.</p>

<p>The evening is concluded with a review of transmissions from Oregon at our base in Gravity Falls.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my third day stationed here in Safehouse Alpha. Accommodations remain pleasant enough - and the communication relays are up enough for me to get communiques from Agents Disney, Netflix and Prime. Agent Hulu has not been heard from for quite some time, however &hellip;</p>

<p>Supplies are starting to run thin, but I remain careful. There are agents of COVID everywhere and I dare not risk exposure - not while the mission is still at risk.</p>

<p>The view from the window of Autobahn 69 still feeds my wanderlust, but the weather - snow and driving wind - largely kept me socked in today.</p>

<p>Did pick up a dead drop from Agent Amazon, though &hellip; a knife - sharp and ready. Codename Target also came through with some potions and some Mexican intel.</p>

<p>Dinner was scrambled eggs &hellip; good protein source, but our stock of carbohydrates - bread, for instance - never arrived.</p>

<p>Ending the day with rum, with our stocks drained to less than half, good ol&rsquo; American Coca Cola, and dispatches from Wakanda.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, if the weather holds, I might make an attempt to reach our agents in the Dunes. Or our forces in the Hot Lands.</p>

<p>I do wonder, though, how much longer this safehouse will hold &hellip; the landlord is getting nosey.</p>

<p>I’ve been diving deeper and deeper into a cooking rabbit hole over the last several years, and it really accelerated this year after a work colleague asked me “What do you do for fun?” and I couldn’t think of an answer and blurted out “Cooking”.</p>

<p>And here we are. I&rsquo;m going to ramble a bit in the hopes that this is interesting to somebody - even if it&rsquo;s me a year from now when I can shake my head ruefully at how silly I was.</p>

<p>Today’s a light day for me. For dinner, I’m making roasted asparagus, twice baked potatoes, and a pair of sous vide, bone-in pork chops. I’ll probably throw in a pan sauce of some sort as well.</p>

<p>The first two of those are familiar: The asparagus is a family favorite and the twice baked potatoes I made on a whim a few weeks back and everybody liked them.</p>

<p>The sous vide is still a new appliance for me. I made a turkey roulade for Christmas with it, and the turkey turned out perfectly moist, but I couldn’t effectively sear that big a mass. I’ve also made a chipotle chicken sort of thing in it for tacos which was fine I guess.</p>

<h3 id="the-setup">The setup</h3>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/69792a19f2.jpg" alt="IMG 9232" title="IMG_9232.JPG" border="0" width="598" height="443" /></p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been setting up our largest cutting board over a towel on one end of our kitchen island as a work station for all my prep work.</p>

<p>I keep my chef’s knife next to the board and a bowl for scraps nearby.</p>

<p>I also have a black cross-strapped (rather than one that ties behind your neck) apron to keep my clothes clean - or really, to give me a place to wipe my hands when I&rsquo;m in a hurry.</p>

<p>If my family&rsquo;s out, I&rsquo;ll bring down my Bluetooth speaker and crank up some classic punk or heavy industrial while I prep and cook. If they&rsquo;re home (like the are today), I&rsquo;ll just use the iPhone speaker and keep it to something clean.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve cooked more and more, I&rsquo;ve learned the importance of prep work - or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place">mise en place</a>. I look at the recipes I&rsquo;m cooking and get all the ingredients ready before anything starts cooking (an exception today might be throwing potatoes in the oven to bake while I prep the rest).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also become a huge believer that you can&rsquo;t have enough towels (we&rsquo;re pushing twenty flour sack towels now) or enough bowls.</p>

<p>The other adjustment I&rsquo;ve made over time is to make sure the dishwasher is empty (or at least dirty with room) and all hand-wash dishes are clean and put away before I start. I generate a lot of dirty dishes and need some out of the way place to put them - having an empty dishwasher works great for that (and makes later cleanup significantly easier).</p>

<p>With all of that out of the way &hellip;</p>

<h3 id="the-prep">The prep</h3>

<p>Like I said, today is pretty light.</p>

<p>I need to poke some holes in some potatoes before chucking them into the oven for an hour.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/6b29c11309.jpg" alt="IMG 4967" title="IMG_4967.JPG" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>I need to mince some garlic for the asparagus, some more for the pan sauce, plus peel a clove for the chops. Aside: I didn&rsquo;t grow up with actual garlic being a thing. It&rsquo;s been one of the earliest and best revelations once I started trying to cook more seriously.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/71fe3c8478.jpg" alt="IMG 0336" title="IMG_0336.JPG" border="0" width="598" height="449" /></p>

<p>I need to trim the particularly woody ends from the asparagus.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/b9a680b164.png" alt="IMG 5499" title="IMG_5499.png" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>I need to cut up a green onion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll need &frac12; cup of buttermilk, a 1/3 cup of sour cream, and a &frac14; of butter for the potatoes.</p>

<p>After that, it&rsquo;s time to season the chops with salt and pepper and get them into a plastic bag. I didn&rsquo;t feel like dragging out the vacuum sealer for this, and ziploc bags work fine using the water displacement technique.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/6c3712efa1.jpg" alt="IMG 1565" title="IMG_1565.JPG" border="0" width="598" height="449" /></p>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to plug in the immersion circulator and let it come up to temp - 147 degrees.</p>

<h3 id="the-cook">The cook</h3>

<p><img src="uploads/2020/383d2727e0.png" alt="IMG 1264" title="IMG_1264.png" border="0" width="225" height="300" style="float:right;" /></p>

<p>Once it&rsquo;s at temp, it&rsquo;s time to drop in the chops and wait an hour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the potatoes are done with the first bake. Time to let them cool a bit before ripping their guts out and mashing them to bits while adding all the other stuff (bacon bits! cheddar cheese! that dairy I mentioned earlier!)</p>

<p>Then it&rsquo;s back into the oven for 20 minutes or so.</p>

<p>The asparagus gets put on a baking sheet, doused in olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper and sprinkled with the minced garlic (aside: this is good with Parmesan cheese, too). They&rsquo;ll go in the oven after the potatoes, but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to get it prepped now.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/2e26e8a356.jpg" alt="IMG 3154" title="IMG_3154.JPG" border="0" width="599" height="449" /></p>

<p>The potatoes come out, and then I crank to oven to 450 degrees before throwing in the asparagus.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/a7c069e687.jpg" alt="IMG 1454" title="IMG_1454.JPG" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chops&rsquo; time in the water bath is up.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/f10c0f4de7.jpg" alt="IMG 1308" title="IMG_1308.JPG" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>I get a pan heating to medium-high on the stove, while I taken them out of their bag (save the juice) and pat them dry with paper towels.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2020/3e6086ca51.png" alt="IMG 8133" title="IMG_8133.png" border="0" width="225" height="300" style="float:left;" /></p>

<p>A little vegetable oil in the pan, and in go the chops to sear - including the edges.</p>

<p>Add a knob of butter and baste the chops with it a bit until everything looks crispy.</p>

<p>Set those on the cutting board to slice in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Pull the asparagus, turn off the oven.</p>

<p>Add some garlic and then the pork juices from the bath to the pan to deglaze and reduce. A splash of apple cider vinegar. Finish by mounting the sauce with some butter and checking for seasoning.</p>

<p>Plate everything up &hellip;</p>

<h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/8e9eae1240.jpg" alt="IMG 2420" title="IMG_2420.JPG" border="0" width="599" height="541" /></p>

<p>The pork looked amazing, but ended up pretty tough. Most of the family didn&rsquo;t finish, and I think I&rsquo;m going to need to experiment a lot more with this sous vide machine because it&rsquo;s hit or miss on delivering what I expect. The pan sauce also didn&rsquo;t work &hellip; I likely needed to empty to fat from the pan before adding the juice and trying to make a sauce.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that was about the best batch of asparagus I&rsquo;ve made in a while and I think everybody went back for seconds of the twice-baked potatoes.</p>

<p>Regardless, tomorrow I&rsquo;m firing things up again to make stuff for my lunches (mashed cauliflower and roasted broccoli to go with some freezer turkey meatloaf) and a batch of chicken and broccoli mac and cheese for dinner with the kids.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ll save you those gory details &hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>While reading Brent Simmon&rsquo;s blog post on his <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/01/01/my_new_years_resolution_is_to_focus_my_a">New Years resolution</a> to better channel his anger, it struck me that I&rsquo;ve been struggling with similar misdirected (and frequently swallowed) anger over the last three years.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also been getting worse. I find myself tipping quickly into anger, then hiding most of it and instead directing into being curt, short and a smart-ass. My family and coworkers might disagree on how well I&rsquo;ve been hiding it, mind you.</p>

<p>A lot of it - for me especially - comes down to a lack of control. I tend to anger when I expect something to be some particular way and then it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Tellingly, the angriest I&rsquo;ve been in my life was one November night in 2016. We&rsquo;re talking shouting and banging my car hood and steering wheel angry.</p>

<p>So much of what I&rsquo;ve been expecting from the outside world is so fundamentally broken that there&rsquo;s a base level of anger already there since that day.</p>

<p>And now, when something at work doesn&rsquo;t work the way I expect it to, or my kids don&rsquo;t do something I expect them to do, or when I realize my wife didn&rsquo;t empty the dishwasher when I went to bed early last night, I feel this flash of anger - when it really shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>

<p>Work stuff happens because something didn&rsquo;t get communicated properly and stuff is hard.</p>

<p>My kids have autism and stuff is hard.</p>

<p>My wife had a long day yesterday and didn&rsquo;t know I was expecting the dishwasher to be empty this morning. It also wasn&rsquo;t a big deal and I did it instead.</p>

<p>Often, that anger is also self-directed &hellip; angry at all the things I&rsquo;m not doing. This anger&rsquo;s not really justified either.</p>

<p>These are all just flashes of anger, rarely expressed or escaping from my brain &hellip; but they&rsquo;re there and they&rsquo;ve been coming more frequently.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m finding that just writing this down is helping more than a little. Admitting that I&rsquo;ve spent much of the last three years kinda angry all the time is helping.</p>

<p>The other things that have helped include cooking (it&rsquo;s one reason I&rsquo;ve been falling deeper and deeper into that particular rabbit hole recently), drinking (alone), sleeping, being alone &hellip; all things that allow me to either tune out the world or to exert some level of control.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m alone, I&rsquo;m in control of what I do - like writing a blog post, for instance.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m cooking, I&rsquo;m in control.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m in control, the anger fades.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s early in 2020, and the world spins further out of control &hellip; but I&rsquo;m going to continue to find avenues where I can have at least the illusion of control, some hard center of certainty in the midst of all the madness and anger to come.</p>

			 <p>In the just passed (observed) decade I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Had a second kid.</li>
<li>Found out both kids are on the Autism Spectrum.</li>
<li>Went into massive medical debt getting them therapy.</li>
<li>Had five jobs - plus a wee bit of freelancing.</li>
<li>Got fired for the first time.</li>
<li>Started a ridiculous quest - to see a home game at every FBS football school.</li>
<li>Tried and failed to build my own company at least three times (maybe more if we count landing pages).</li>
<li>Had the two most rewarding jobs of my career (in two very different ways).</li>
<li>Lost contact with a lot of friends and family.</li>
<li>Grew to love Indianapolis and become frustrated with Indiana.</li>
<li>Quit smoking after doing so pretty regularly since college.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I look forward to the next (observed) decade:</p>

<ul>
<li>I’ll get to see those kids graduate high school and start college (or get darn close). OMFG.</li>
<li>I’ll try to teach those kids to drive.</li>
<li>I intend to make a lot more progress on my quest.</li>
<li>Sometime in there, that debt load should clear - at least I surely hope so.</li>
<li>As my kids get older, it should get easier to keep up with folks.</li>
<li>Do what I can to improve Indy - even if it’s just picking up litter.</li>
<li>Cook a lot more.</li>
<li>Travel a lot more.</li>
<li>Double down on the good stuff, the stuff I like, and try to minimize the stuff I don’t.</li>
<li>Screw up just as much stuff - if not more - than I did the last ten years.</li>

<p>Along the way, I made gravy from the trimmings and homemade chicken stock, helped my wife make a kickass chocolate roll cake, plus a whole bunch of sides.</p>

<p>Nothing left now but to finish this bottle of wine I <em>had</em> to open to make the cranberry sauce.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas.</p>

			 <p>Things I said to my daughter today after struggling with martial arts board breaking:</p>

<p>“Most of my job as a parent is to help you believe in yourself as much as I believe in you. You are so strong, and so tough and capable of doing anything you want. And you’re way tougher than a measly board.”</p>

<p>Right before bed, she wanted another shot.</p>

<p>First try. Crack, break.</p>

<p>So proud.

<p>Fresh off a six-night trip to Florida&rsquo;s Walt Disney World with the family (photos <a href="https://chrisvannoy.micro.blog/2018/01/09/had-a-fun.html">here</a>, <a href="https://chrisvannoy.micro.blog/2018/01/09/even-fireworks-photos.html">here</a> and <a href="https://chrisvannoy.micro.blog/2018/01/09/anyway-we-had.html">here</a>), here are a few things I wish I knew before I went:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everybody there is also a tourist and everybody - from cast members to fellow park goers - is going to be super friendly and super nice (your mileage may vary).</li>
<li>The MagicBands can be resized for little kids. The gray part of it can be ripped off so they&rsquo;re much, much smaller and fit around their little wrists way better (otherwise, they overlap more than a little bit).</li>
<li>The green bin/garbage can in your resort room (if you stay on property) is not a garbage can &hellip; it&rsquo;s for recycling.</li>
<li>The front desk of your resort will tell you that buses to the parks start running an hour before the parks open. They&rsquo;re lying to you - I don&rsquo;t know the exact time, but they start running well before then generally.</li>
<li>Speaking of opening: Rope. Drop. Every. Day. Be there at park open because lines are never going to be lower than they are then (and lines suck).</li>
<li>Know that you&rsquo;re not going to get to everything you want to get to.</li>
<li>Know that you&rsquo;re going to do far, far less than you had planned (and be OK with this)</li>
<li>The fireworks crowds in Magic Kingdom especially are <em>insane</em> - from the castle all the way back to the end of Main Street. Some good viewing spots we stumbled into there:

<ul>
<li>From the train station platform at the end of Main Street (just don&rsquo;t plan to get back into the rest of the park easily after the fireworks &hellip; you&rsquo;ll be fighting traffic).</li>
<li>Off to the side a bit in Tomorrowland (near Tomorrowland Terrace, <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/magic-kingdom/tomorrowland-terrace-fireworks-dessert-party/">where you pay $ for the spot</a> &hellip; the crowd&rsquo;s also fairly thin in that area, or was on our night)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your significant other and/or kids will want to meet college students cosplaying as their favorite Disney characters. Be OK with this &hellip; and know that their lines will sometimes be longer than the rides you want to go on.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re OK with it, going on rides during parades or fireworks can result in lower wait times. We managed to get a second trip through Haunted Mansion this way thanks to the 3 o&rsquo;clock parade.</li>
<li>DoleWhip (pineapple ice cream) is <em>awesome</em> (and available in MK only at a shop in Adventureland next to Aladdin&rsquo;s Magic Carpets as far as I could find)</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re on the dining plan, treat your snack credits as breakfast (there are some <em>huge</em> cinnamon rolls to be found all over the place)</li>
<li>For MK, most folks are heading to the right of the park at the open - to Space Mountain and/or Seven Dwarves Mine Train (side note: 7DMT is a <em>very</em> disappointing ride). If you want to make the most of the light early crowds, I&rsquo;d suggest going left - toward Jungle Cruise, Adventureland, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Frontierland.</li>
<li>Once you&rsquo;ve used your three <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/fastpass-plus/">FastPasses</a> for the day, refresh the <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/mobile-apps/">MyDisneyExperience app</a> like crazy &hellip; even for fairly popular rides (we snagged seconds of Space Mountain, Everest and others this way) passes will pop up.</li>
<li>Even on very busy days (we went during the tail end of the holidays plus <a href="https://www.rundisney.com/disneyworld-marathon/">Marathon Weekend</a>), as long as you&rsquo;ve planned well, use your FastPasses and be flexible, you shouldn&rsquo;t be in a line of more than 20 minutes or so &hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless your significant other or children decides they want to meet Joy and Sadness at Epcot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PS: Ask for things! If you or your family has a request, even if it seems odd, ask someone about it and see what shakes out. There are lots of cool &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; that you can only see if you show interest to a cast member. (via <a href="http://blog.atmartin.io/">Alex Martin</a>)</p>

<p>The new Pandora/Avatar area of Animal Kingdom is amazing but super-crowded. The headlining attraction, <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/animal-kingdom/avatar-flight-of-passage/">&ldquo;Flight of Passage&rdquo;</a> is especially awe-inspiring but gets an hour-plus wait right at rope drop (translation: it&rsquo;s where everybody goes at rope drop) and can break three-plus hour waits shortly thereafter. Getting a FastPass to it is your highest possible priority and then you can rope drop the <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/animal-kingdom/navi-river-journey/"><em>other</em> attraction</a> while everybody&rsquo;s in line for that. Tips on managing FastPasses and longer-term trip planning coming in a later post. (Ed.)</p>

<p>Yesterday, in advance of Nova&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/vaccines-calling-shots.html">program on vaccines</a> (embedded above), I tweeted the following:</p>

<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Vaccines do not cause Autism. To be honest, there’s likely nothing that “causes” Autism. It’s just there. That’s it. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vaccinesNOVA?src=hash">#vaccinesNOVA</a></p>&mdash; Chris Vannoy (@chris_vannoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_vannoy/status/509852004047671298">September 10, 2014</a></blockquote>
</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I received a wave of responses from the anti-vaxx folks thanks to that. It wasn&#8217;t unexpected and <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_vannoy/status/509876043965272065">it could have been worse</a>.</p>

<p>In the past, I&#8217;ve reacted to this stance and mindset from <a href="http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/of-measles-and-autism/">a place of anger</a>. I still stand behind most of that, but last night I thought more about the roots of why parents and others cling so tightly to such a widely discredited theory. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m a parent of now two children - both diagnosed with Autism. And I know - at least a little - what other parents go through. </p>

<p>A doctor tells you your child, the light of your life, has a condition that no one knows where it comes from or how to make it better<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. For a bit, the doctor probably leaves your little family alone in the exam room. Just you, your significant other and the child you now have been told there is something &#8220;wrong&#8221; with. </p>

<p>Maybe they play with a toy or line up blocks while you try to gather yourself. </p>

<p>And the questions start. </p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>Did we do something wrong?</p>

<p>Is my child broken?<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>

<p>What caused this?</p>

<p>The problem is that the last question has no answer. You can ask the doctor and they might give you some leading theories - genetics, environment and the like - but the truth is <em>no one knows</em>.</p>

<p>There is no answer. There might be no cause at all. It&#8217;s entirely possible that this is simply what your child is - always has been and always will be to a degree. </p>

<p>We all like answers. Especially to burning questions like &#8220;Why?&#8221; Especially when it affects your child. </p>

<p>So, we grasp for answers. And we latch on to whatever seems to answer this unanswerable question that maps best to our own existing belief system or which answer makes us feel better or what answer we hear the most or the answer that gives us someone/thing to blame. </p>

<p>Some answer that gives <em>reason</em> to that lonely moment alone in the exam room - still sitting in the wreckage with a head full of questions to which there are few if any satisfying answers. </p>

<p>You spend the weeks, months, years ahead still yearning for those answers. It&#8217;s a hole that needs filled in your heart and in your soul. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Why my son?</p>

<p>Why my daughter?</p>

<p>So you find something to latch on to - something to fill that hole. It can be vaccines. It can be gluten or lactose or gut bugs. It can even be nothing - but even then the question remains itching at the back our your skull on random nights while you try to fall asleep. </p>

<p>There might be an answer someday. Maybe. </p>

<p>But in the meantime, there is just a hole that needs filled. </p>

<p>And any old thing will do. </p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The reasons for why you&rsquo;re hiring have a great deal of impact on how you go about the hiring process.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re hiring because of another developer leaving, you&rsquo;re going to be much more time-crunched than, say, a situation where you need more developer bandwidth for upcoming projects or simply future growth.</p>

<p>In general, though, you might find it useful to keep the following overarching guidelines in mind when you begin the hiring process:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Be flexible:</strong> You&rsquo;re always going to look to hire the best-possible person (note: I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;developer&rdquo;) you can. But there might be times and circumstances where you find a pair of more junior-level hires instead. And maybe that makes sense. Or you might find a heavy-duty frontend developer with some light backend chops when you&rsquo;re looking for a backend person to complete a particular upcoming project.</p>

<p>The key is to think more about how a possible hire fits in with the atmosphere and general workflow of your company than it sometimes is to fill a specific need.</p>

<p>It might be the old sportswriter in me, but in general my philosophy reminds me the philosophy some NFL teams have when it comes to their annual draft: Draft the best available, regardless of position.</p>

<p>And, for me at least, that&rsquo;s generally how I look at hiring: I try to hire the best available, even if they may not be a perfect fit for the particular need I had in mind when I started the hiring process.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve hired more senior guys when I went looking for junior-level candidates. I&rsquo;ve also hired frontend guys with a wee bit of backend when I&rsquo;ve gone looking for backend talent.</p>

<p>The key in all circumstances is that you take the long view on a hire. What you&rsquo;re hiring for right this second - whatever pressing need you&rsquo;re trying to fill - might not be a pressing need in a few month&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>Even more importantly, the developer you hire today will not be the same developer you&rsquo;re employing six months or a year from now. The name badge will have the same name, but the work they do for you and the atmosphere you surround them with will change them along the way, hopefully for the better.</p>

<p>Developers grow and change along the way, largely because programming is more craft than skill. The more a developer does it, the better they become (generally speaking).</p>

<p>In short: Hire for the future, not necessarily for the immediate need.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be a dick:</strong> Sorry for the crudeness, but it&rsquo;s the truth. Being a nice, open guy or gal is a real advantage when it comes to hiring.</p>

<p>Always keep in mind that even the developers you have on staff are inundated with recruiter pitches.</p>

<p>Every developer you&rsquo;ve hired or know of can likely get another job tomorrow at the drop of a hat. Some realize this, some don&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s a fact.</p>

<p>As such, unless you&rsquo;re Google, or Twitter, or Facebook or some such, by and large working at your company, from a developer&rsquo;s perspective, is not a privilege. In a way, it&rsquo;s a favor to you.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind when hiring. The less hoops you make a developer jump through and the more you can make them feel appreciated and wanted, the better success rate you&rsquo;re going to see.</p>

<p>And, yes, I realize this just devolved into relationship advice, but some truths are universal.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Be curious:</strong> When I was on the other end of the hiring scenario - interviewing for jobs - I had my best success when I went into an interview thinking not of how to land the job, but more about what I can learn from the experience.</p>

<p>And it’s the same now that I’m on the other side. I go into my research phase or un-interviews looking to learn something new. Maybe it’s learning more about related programming languages, or even how developers minds work, but there’s always something there.</p>

<p>And the things you learn along the way - just from being curious, digging down rabbit holes and asking off-topic questions in conversation - can spark new ideas in both hiring and the management of your in-house developers later.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Be patient:</strong> Because I generally go into hiring mode with a specific list of candidates in mind, my own hiring process tends to go pretty quickly.</p>

<p>But I’m not afraid of having it take a while, either.</p>

<p>Because you’re hiring someone you are (hopefully) going to be working with for a good, long while and you want to make sure you hire the right person.</p>

<p>That said &hellip;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Trust your gut:</strong> When it comes time to make a decision - to hire or not, or even to contact or not - don’t try to overanalyze it.</p></li>

			 <p>I'm kicking off a new weekly feature today where I compile together links that caught my interest over the past week that are at least somewhat tangentially related to my in-progress book.</p>

<h3><a href="https://peepcode.com/products/byc-michael-lopp">Build Your Career: Michael Lopp (PeepCode)</a></h3>

<p>Lopp, better known as <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/">Rands</a> in some circles, has been a huge influence on me ever since I first stepped into management. This PeepCode course focused on managing your career as a developer is sure to be fantastic. Were I still developing, it'd plunk down the $12 immediately. I'd suggest you do the same.</p>

<h3><a href="http://basho.com/erlang-at-basho-five-years-later/">Erlang at Basho, Five Years Later</a></h3>

<p>Basho, the makers of the <a href="http://basho.com/riak/">Riak</a> database mention one key point in this blog post: That they sought out developers who knew the subject matter much more than developers who had experience with the specific programming language they were using (Erlang).</p>

<p>I go into this quite a bit in my book. More than knowledge of your specific programming language, you want to look for developers who have knowledge of and experience with multiple languages. You want folks that are curious and able to pick up new concepts and languages quickly, so it makes sense to find folks who have demonstrated that ability already.</p>

<h3><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-manage-remote-team/">21 Months In: How to Manage a Remote Team</a></h3>

<p>I don't currently manage a remote team, but this post is filled with practical advice and tips for how you should go about it. Fantastic list of tools in the middle of the post as well.</p>

<h3><a href="http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/find-perfect-employee/">Hiring Managers: Don’t Try to Find the Perfect Employee!</a></h3>

<p>I mentioned this post on Twitter the other day, but it bears repeating:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Nice thoughts here, but entirely too much reliance on recruiters and job ads. <a href="http://t.co/5qXspnHlSb">http://t.co/5qXspnHlSb</a> There&#39;s a better way.</p>&mdash; Chris Vannoy (@chris_vannoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_vannoy/statuses/349546017366089728">June 25, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>I have an entire chapter of the book titled "The Douchebag Test," so you know I'm on-board with this. Hire good <em>people</em> first, then move on to the good developer question.</p>

<p>On a final note:</p>

<h2>Book update</h2>

<p>I'm a good bit through the book right now, covering things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why you shouldn't use recruiters</li>
<li>How to get away without doing traditional interviews</li>
<li>What sort of questions to ask in your un-interview</li>
<li>And many more</li>
</ul>

<p>You can sign up for updates on the book below. As a special bonus, I'm also working on an email course for subscribers that will walk through finding, hiring and managing outside development firms (freelancers, consultants and the like). It's almost done now and filled to the brim with hard-learned lessons and tips.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Before I started writing my current book (dingus down at the bottom of the post to get the first two chapters free) on hiring developers, I started a book on getting hired as developer or designer.</p>

<p>I might come back to it someday, but I thought I&rsquo;d share one of the early chapters I had written for that book since it dovetails nicely with parts of the new book I&rsquo;m currently writing from the opposite perspective.</p>

<p>Enjoy, and let me know if you have any other tips for job seeking developers.</p>

<p>[hr]</p>

<p>Before you start firing off resumes and inquiries willy-nilly, you have some work to do.</p>

<p>A resume alone won&rsquo;t get you very far, but a resume combined with the following can greatly increase your chances.</p>

<p><h4>Get social</h4>
If you know where you&rsquo;d like to apply, find contacts for people who work there. LinkedIn works great for this.</p>

<p>Find them on Twitter and follow them. Lurk for a while and then engage. Don&rsquo;t ask if they&rsquo;re hiring or ask for a job — your only goal here if to raise their awareness.</p>

<p>Let me give you a real-life example:</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript" src="//storify.com/ChrisVannoy/conversation-with-ryanbillingsley.js" language="javascript"></script>
<noscript>[<a href="//storify.com/ChrisVannoy/conversation-with-ryanbillingsley" target="_blank">View the story &ldquo;Conversation with @ryanbillingsley&rdquo; on Storify</a>]</noscript></p>

<p>When it came time to hire a backend developer, I already knew Ryan — at least the name. When I started surfing through <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for candidates, he came up again.</p>

<p>Later, we hired him.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been great, by the way.</p>

<p><h4>Speaking of LinkedIn</h4>
I know LinkedIn can seem somewhat pointless from your seat — little more than a vector for recruiter spam. But it&rsquo;s hugely helpful on the hiring end.</p>

<p>With a <a href="http://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/products.html">recruiter account</a>, you get access to tons of facets that allow you to hone down to precisely the skill set and person you&rsquo;re looking for. From there, you can add them to project lists and keep track of how often and how you contacted them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the only place employers go hunting, but hooboy is it helpful.</p>

<p>And even if you don&rsquo;t show up in searches, I can guarantee you&rsquo;ll be searched for once you apply. A lot of hiring management software packages will even do this automatically.</p>

<p>So, you need a LinkedIn page.</p>

<p>Fill out your job experience — if you&rsquo;re in college include whatever you can, even if it doesn&rsquo;t strike you as relevant. Fill out the Skills section. Link up your social accounts — or better: a personal site, Dribbble and/or Github profiles.</p>

<p>In essence, make it as complete as you can.</p>

<p>In the contact area settings, make sure you have it set for &ldquo;career opportunities&rdquo; and &ldquo;job inquiries&rdquo;. After all, you&rsquo;re looking for a job, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be reading this book, right?</p>

<p>If you have endorsements or write up the bio area, great. But you can consider both optional. A great bio has never gotten anyone hired, but a bad one has stopped more than a few hirings.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s better to just leave it blank.
<h4>Dribbble and GitHub</h4>
Now we&rsquo;re in to the nitty-gritty of what&rsquo;s going to set you apart once you begin applying.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a designer, sign up for an account on <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a> and post your work there whenever you can.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a developer, do the same on <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>. Fork an open source repo or post code of your own, but get code on there.</p>

<p>Much like LinkedIn, Dribbble and GitHub are great places to get discovered and are becoming go-to places for hiring managers like myself to go hunting for talent. But more than that, you want to be able to point hiring managers to work.</p>

<p>Because when it comes to web designers and developers nothing (and I mean nothing) speaks louder than the work. You can interview great, have the best resume in the world, but if I can&rsquo;t see work, I&rsquo;m always going to worry.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ll likely hire somebody else instead, all other things being equal.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m still waiting to hear back on <a href="http://followindy.com">FollowIndy</a>&rsquo;s status in <a href="http://generalprop.newschallenge.org/SNC/ViewItem.aspx?pguid=dc3ab619-8eb5-4ac5-ae7b-36b7e98bddc9&amp;itemguid=88b468f0-189c-4973-9983-3ea1291f9a44">Round Two</a> of the <a href="http://newschallenge.org">Knight News Challenge</a> for this year, but I wanted to take a moment to give a clearer picture of where I plan to take it, regardless of Knight funding.</p>

<p>For several years now, I&rsquo;ve found software inspiration in an odd place: <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a>, the ubiquitous music-management software behind all those iPods and iPhones Apple has sold. Most <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/business/media/12carr.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=itunes%20news&amp;st=cse">newspaper intelligentsia</a> focus on the iTunes Store, looking for a way out of the media&rsquo;s revenue woes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I looked at the iTunes application itself and at the way it made a formerly tedious task — finding and organizing your music — fun, useful and good for hours of time-wasting knob-tweaking.</p>

<p>It also has the added benefit of making it easy to unearth favorite music, both old and new, a variety of different ways.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already built <a href="http://photos.indystar.com">a photo and gallery management system</a> that drew some inspiration from iTunes. With FollowIndy, I ultimately want to take that inspiration to another level and apply it to news in general.</p>

<p>It starts with making sure there&rsquo;s a good base of content. FollowIndy currently has that, but I want to add more. There are a lot of smaller publications in the Indianapolis metro area that I&rsquo;m not yet including and even more newsworthy blogs.</p>

<p>If I know about it, I want FollowIndy to have it.</p>

<p>But I will never know everything. And sometimes, Indy-relevant news happens outside of Indy-area news organizations. The recent machinations involving <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/NewsSearch?st=bayh&amp;">Evan Bayh</a> and earlier <a href="http://www.the-daily-record.com/news/article/4756614">Tim Durham</a> bear witness to that.</p>

<p>What I intend to build is any easy way to add content ala carte to FollowIndy. A way that adds the content as a first-class citizen with all the metadata of everything else.</p>

<p>Once we have all that data, the fun can begin.</p>

<p>I want FollowIndy to have playlists of news: user-defined user-sorted playlists, smart playlists and even genius playlists of news that allow users to find, organize and disseminate the news they care about, regardless of source.</p>

<p>And I want to make that fun, useful and good for hours of time-wasting knob-tweaking.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the start, I want FollowIndy to do this regardless of how the Knight funding turns out. And it <em>will</em> do this regardless of how the Knight funding turns out.</p>

<p>What winning a Knight grant gets me is the ability to choose fast and good from the matrix of good, fast and cheap. Right now, I&rsquo;m forced to go the route of good and cheap.</p>

<p>And the work begins anew tonight.</p>
