				"title": "Let's talk about intent",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>In a recent life, I used to joke that I was in charge of all the &ldquo;creepy stuff&rdquo; at a Marketing Technology startup.</p>\n\n<p>I was a product manager in charge of things like identifying anonymous visitors, intent (more on this soon) and advertising targeting.</p>\n\n<p>I helped build systems which would take an ip address, triangulate it between different sources of identification and settle on what company or account to attribute it to in a world at the time where most everybody was working from home.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way, I talked with lots of providers of third-party identification and intent about what they had and how they do things so we could integrate it into our own systems.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not in that world anymore, and don&rsquo;t particularly care to get back into it, so let&rsquo;s talk a bit about how it all works. And why <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/retentionadam_over-the-past-60-days-my-coo-and-i-have-activity-7154587668578816000-9Gir\">this dude</a> is about to have a bad time - even if he&rsquo;s right about a lot of it!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<p>So, for those not deep in this space, let&rsquo;s talk about marketing.</p>\n\n<p>Marketers at Business To Business (B2B) startups - newish companies, largely fed by venture funding, and largely selling to one another - are increasingly tied to sales teams and revenue numbers as part of an overall Go To Market (GTM) strategy (this space <em>loves</em> their acronyms).</p>\n\n<p>As part of that, sales hunger for leads - folks to talk to about buying their software or services. And sales drives revenue, and revenue drives venture funding and so forth. When it&rsquo;s working well, it&rsquo;s all a very fun and somewhat virtuous cycle.</p>\n\n<p>So a lot of marketing has become sales assistance and support as a primary driver. There are still some folks doing squishier &ldquo;brand awareness&rdquo; marketing but they&rsquo;re few and far between.</p>\n\n<p>Marketing works to drive folks to their website and offerings through content, or advertising, or social media posting.</p>\n\n<p>Once those visitors land on the site, in order to turn them into sales leads, they need to be identified.</p>\n\n<p>One way to do this is through what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;gated&rdquo; content - things like ebooks, reports, templates and such that require a visitor to leave an email address and various other data to get access to the content.</p>\n\n<p>The other way is to try and tease out who the visitor is using things like third-party cookies or their ip address to try and unmask them to one degree or another.</p>\n\n<p>Then you can reach out to these companies to try and set up a proper sales call.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to these first-party sources of leads, there also exists a universe of third-party &ldquo;intent&rdquo; offerings that can be used to build lists for sales teams to try and do cold outreach to, or to power Account Based Marketing (ABM) programs of advertising.</p>\n\n<p>These platforms - <a href=\"https://bombora.com/\">Bombora</a>, <a href=\"https://6sense.com/\">6Sense</a>, <a href=\"https://www.demandbase.com/\">Demandbase</a>, etc - do the same anonymous identification I mentioned earlier, trying to tie an anonymous visitor to a company. Then they look at the pages or sites they&rsquo;re visiting and attach that visit to various terms or keywords.</p>\n\n<p>And they can also tie the company identification to lots of sources of company firmographic (location, size, revenue, etc) data to filter lists of companies by.</p>\n\n<p>So, they can make it so you can say things like &ldquo;Show me all the companies with revenue above $50 Million in San Fransisco that have looked at pages about content distribution&rdquo; and then you can hand that list of companies to your cold-calling/emailing team (typically called Sales or Business Development Representatives) or use them for advertising targeting using platforms like <a href=\"https://terminus.com/\">Terminus</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these intent platforms will also calculate things like &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; or &ldquo;surges&rdquo; which are intended to indicate a change in the consumption of things about these topics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-problems-with-intent\">The problems with intent</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we have the background out of the way, here&rsquo;s some of the ways this can go wrong.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the data sources behind this are shared between providers. They&rsquo;re all essentially using the same blocks of ip addresses and the same wells of third-party cookies and drawing intent from the same set of media partners and the like.</p>\n\n<p>For the company identification, they&rsquo;re making guesses based on various probabilistic algorithms across all these different data sources. Sometimes these guesses are really good! Sometimes, they are very wrong.</p>\n\n<p>These guesses got a lot worse once the pandemic hit and everybody started working from home and were no longer tied to corporate networks in many cases. Additionally, a lot of internet usage is done through personal email logins rather than business email logins, so many of these sources have your gmail address and not your bigco.com email email address. These platforms and providers have to build bridges between those.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s before you get into coffee shops and working spaces and VPNs that muddy the IP data even more.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the third-party cookie data is also increasingly shrinking in relevance. Those cookies only work in Google Chrome these days and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/goodbye-third-party-cookies/\">won&rsquo;t for much longer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When you&rsquo;re targeting advertising off of this data, it&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re wasting some of your advertising budget, but nobody gets all that upset about it. It&rsquo;s weird when you see a LinkedIn advertisement for something that isn&rsquo;t a great fit for you, but most folks don&rsquo;t think much about it.</p>\n\n<p>The problem you run into - and many of these platforms are starting to run into this problem now as many of their customers look for software subscriptions that they can cut - is when you hand this same data over to your sales team.</p>\n\n<p>Once your sales team is calling or emailing folks cold from them visiting your site or their showing some level of &ldquo;intent&rdquo; about some topic or another, that can be a different story. One or two misses of identification and many sales users of these platforms write off the entire endeavor.</p>\n\n<p>If you clicked through that LinkedIn post earlier, he mentions that he&rsquo;s talked to customers of these platforms and didn&rsquo;t find anybody all that excited about them. That&rsquo;s largely feedback from sales teams which have likely been burned repeatedly by either bad account identification <em>or</em> flaky levels of &ldquo;intent&rdquo; being shown (where one or two page visits might be enough to &ldquo;spike&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>As a final bit of foreshadowing, this is all hazy and sketchy at the <em>company</em> level of the data. I&rsquo;ve looked at them and spot-checked a lot of them - they&rsquo;re bad and inaccurate about the company identification everywhere. And if they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re extremely limited to company-owned IP addresses and sure-fire identities meaning you have lots of holes and not a lot of useful data to work with - quality, but no quantity.</p>\n\n<p>When I cross-compared many of these services for company identification against things like internal signals, the best match rates I found was less than a coin flip for accuracy. Maybe they&rsquo;ve gotten better in the last couple of years - but the world&rsquo;s been making it harder for them, not easier.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-personal\">Getting personal</h2>\n\n<p>That linked LinkedIn post earlier also mentions launching a new thing that doesn&rsquo;t just identify the <em>company</em> making a visit or showing intent, but the <em>individual</em> doing so.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve talked with a <em>lot</em> of lawyers in my previous role &hellip; and that&rsquo;s not going to fly if you&rsquo;re doing any business or seeing any visitors from Europe - or California.</p>\n\n<p>Privacy laws such as <a href=\"https://www.cookieyes.com/blog/ccpa-vs-gdpr/\">GDPR and CCPA</a> mean you&rsquo;re taking on a lot of legal liability when you start tying together personally identifiable information (PII). Even the company level identification we&rsquo;ve been talking about so far often involves sweet-talking lawyers to get things across the line.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go down the PII rabbit hole and try to uncover the precise individual doing activities, you&rsquo;re inviting a boatload of lawyerly attention the second you get big enough for them to care.</p>\n\n<p>Not that I think you would!</p>\n\n<p>Because, as mentioned earlier - the folks who want the individual level are <em>sales</em> users.

				"content_text": "In a recent life, I used to joke that I was in charge of all the \"creepy stuff\" at a Marketing Technology startup.\n\nI was a product manager in charge of things like identifying anonymous visitors, intent (more on this soon) and advertising targeting.\n\nI helped build systems which would take an ip address, triangulate it between different sources of identification and settle on what company or account to attribute it to in a world at the time where most everybody was working from home.\n\nAlong the way, I talked with lots of providers of third-party identification and intent about what they had and how they do things so we could integrate it into our own systems.\n\nI'm not in that world anymore, and don't particularly care to get back into it, so let's talk a bit about how it all works. And why [this dude](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/retentionadam_over-the-past-60-days-my-coo-and-i-have-activity-7154587668578816000-9Gir) is about to have a bad time - even if he's right about a lot of it!\n\n## Background\n\nSo, for those not deep in this space, let's talk about marketing.\n\nMarketers at Business To Business (B2B) startups - newish companies, largely fed by venture funding, and largely selling to one another - are increasingly tied to sales teams and revenue numbers as part of an overall Go To Market (GTM) strategy (this space _loves_ their acronyms).\n\nAs part of that, sales hunger for leads - folks to talk to about buying their software or services. And sales drives revenue, and revenue drives venture funding and so forth. When it's working well, it's all a very fun and somewhat virtuous cycle.\n\nSo a lot of marketing has become sales assistance and support as a primary driver. There are still some folks doing squishier \"brand awareness\" marketing but they're few and far between.\n\nMarketing works to drive folks to their website and offerings through content, or advertising, or social media posting.\n\nOnce those visitors land on the site, in order to turn them into sales leads, they need to be identified.\n\nOne way to do this is through what's called \"gated\" content - things like ebooks, reports, templates and such that require a visitor to leave an email address and various other data to get access to the content.\n\nThe other way is to try and tease out who the visitor is using things like third-party cookies or their ip address to try and unmask them to one degree or another.\n\nThen you can reach out to these companies to try and set up a proper sales call.\n\nIn addition to these first-party sources of leads, there also exists a universe of third-party \"intent\" offerings that can be used to build lists for sales teams to try and do cold outreach to, or to power Account Based Marketing (ABM) programs of advertising.\n\nThese platforms - <a href=\"https://bombora.com/\">Bombora</a>, <a href=\"https://6sense.com/\">6Sense</a>, <a href=\"https://www.demandbase.com/\">Demandbase</a>, etc - do the same anonymous identification I mentioned earlier, trying to tie an anonymous visitor to a company. Then they look at the pages or sites they're visiting and attach that visit to various terms or keywords.\n\nAnd they can also tie the company identification to lots of sources of company firmographic (location, size, revenue, etc) data to filter lists of companies by.\n\nSo, they can make it so you can say things like \"Show me all the companies with revenue above $50 Million in San Fransisco that have looked at pages about content distribution\" and then you can hand that list of companies to your cold-calling/emailing team (typically called Sales or Business Development Representatives) or use them for advertising targeting using platforms like <a href=\"https://terminus.com/\">Terminus</a>.\n\nMany of these intent platforms will also calculate things like \"spikes\" or \"surges\" which are intended to indicate a change in the consumption of things about these topics.\n\n## The problems with intent\n\nNow that we have the background out of the way, here's some of the ways this can go wrong.\n\nA lot of the data sources behind this are shared between providers. They're all essentially using the same blocks of ip addresses and the same wells of third-party cookies and drawing intent from the same set of media partners and the like.\n\nFor the company identification, they're making guesses based on various probabilistic algorithms across all these different data sources. Sometimes these guesses are really good! Sometimes, they are very wrong.\n\nThese guesses got a lot worse once the pandemic hit and everybody started working from home and were no longer tied to corporate networks in many cases. Additionally, a lot of internet usage is done through personal email logins rather than business email logins, so many of these sources have your gmail address and not your bigco.com email email address. These platforms and providers have to build bridges between those.\n\nThat's before you get into coffee shops and working spaces and VPNs that muddy the IP data even more.\n\nFinally, the third-party cookie data is also increasingly shrinking in relevance. Those cookies only work in Google Chrome these days and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/goodbye-third-party-cookies/\">won't for much longer</a>.\n\nWhen you're targeting advertising off of this data, it's fine. You're wasting some of your advertising budget, but nobody gets all that upset about it. It's weird when you see a LinkedIn advertisement for something that isn't a great fit for you, but most folks don't think much about it.\n\nThe problem you run into - and many of these platforms are starting to run into this problem now as many of their customers look for software subscriptions that they can cut - is when you hand this same data over to your sales team.\n\nOnce your sales team is calling or emailing folks cold from them visiting your site or their showing some level of \"intent\" about some topic or another, that can be a different story. One or two misses of identification and many sales users of these platforms write off the entire endeavor.\n\nIf you clicked through that LinkedIn post earlier, he mentions that he's talked to customers of these platforms and didn't find anybody all that excited about them. That's largely feedback from sales teams which have likely been burned repeatedly by either bad account identification _or_ flaky levels of \"intent\" being shown (where one or two page visits might be enough to \"spike\").\n\nAs a final bit of foreshadowing, this is all hazy and sketchy at the _company_ level of the data. I've looked at them and spot-checked a lot of them - they're bad and inaccurate about the company identification everywhere. And if they're not, they're extremely limited to company-owned IP addresses and sure-fire identities meaning you have lots of holes and not a lot of useful data to work with - quality, but no quantity.\n\nWhen I cross-compared many of these services for company identification against things like internal signals, the best match rates I found was less than a coin flip for accuracy. Maybe they've gotten better in the last couple of years - but the world's been making it harder for them, not easier.\n\n## Getting personal\n\nThat linked LinkedIn post earlier also mentions launching a new thing that doesn't just identify the _company_ making a visit or showing intent, but the _individual_ doing so.\n\nI've talked with a _lot_ of lawyers in my previous role ... and that's not going to fly if you're doing any business or seeing any visitors from Europe - or California.\n\nPrivacy laws such as <a href=\"https://www.cookieyes.com/blog/ccpa-vs-gdpr/\">GDPR and CCPA</a> mean you're taking on a lot of legal liability when you start tying together personally identifiable information (PII). Even the company level identification we've been talking about so far often involves sweet-talking lawyers to get things across the line.\n\nIf you're going to go down the PII rabbit hole and try to uncover the precise individual doing activities, you're inviting a boatload of lawyerly attention the second you get big enough for them to care.\n\nNot that I think you would!\n\nBecause, as mentioned earlier - the folks who want the individual level are _sales_ users. Everybody wants the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/\">Glengarry</a> leads, after all.\n\nToday's company-level intent providers are already struggling with coverage, misidentification, and eroding trust.\n\nNow imagine you try to figure out who exactly at those companies are making this activity. And imagine some Sales Development Representative somewhere fires off an AI-generated cold email outreach or picks up the phone and gives them a ring before they get ahold of somebody that doesn't match.\n\nHow long do you think they'll keep doing that?\n\nHow many times do they get wrong numbers, angry people, and coffeeshop strangers before they stop using it entirely?\n\nFrom my experience, that number is quite low ... and my educated guess is any service trying to dig out individuals is either going to trigger that experience frequently - or, if they lean into ironclad identification, there's not enough meat on the bone to be valuable.\n\nAnd that's all before the lawyers get hold of you!\n\nGodspeed, my dude, and good luck - you'll need heaping amounts of both.\n\n## Wait. So, what should I do?\n\nIf you're a consumer like me and want to opt out of this world as best you can, use something other than Chrome, turn off third-party cookies, run a VPN and laugh.\n\nIf you're a marketer using one of these platforms, check with your sales teams and see how they're finding the accuracy suits them. If they're happy with what these platforms are unearthing, keep going! I'm not suggesting you stop doing stuff you and your team think are working!\n\nIf they're not happy, though, it might be time to try a different approach to marketing. Identify your audience, talk to them, be curious, try to be helpful! Don't go looking for \"intent\", look for ways you can be helpful and honestly help people. And then marry that with intent sources that are in your control - gated form fills, newsletter subscribers, social media followers (well, less this bucket), that sort of thing.\n\nBut that's me. Typing this behind a VPN ...\n\nStay safe out there, folks!\n",

				"content_text": "It’s 2022 today, and Happy New Year to you and yours. \n\nThe year past was at a macro level, a bit of a hellscape, but at a micro/personal level, far rosier. \n\nWe managed to travel safely - around Indiana, to a relatively secluded beach, a weekend in Chicago, and then NYC/Boston. I switched from Engineering to Product at work. I found a thing I believe in to work on on the side. I started regular therapy. \n\nI enter the new year in a pretty positive place - with goals defined long ago, clear plans to get to those goals, and a new sense of self gained over the last year. \n\nI’m excited - and not afraid to admit that.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s some bits I learned along the way in 2021:\n\n1. I like hiking - mostly fairly flat stuff for now\n2. A daily walk is a key part of maintaining my mental health\n3. Therapy isn't as scary as I thought\n4. I can live without Slack - and many other things - on my phone\n5. [Outdoor Research](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/us/) tends to make things I like and that fit me\n6. Adding a [tiny bit of cornstarch](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/dining/perfect-scrambled-eggs.html) to the eggs makes it way harder to overcook scrambled eggs\n7. I spend entirely too much time on my phone\n8. Getting a passport is easier than I expected - and feels pretty liberating, too\n9. Michigan State fans are good people, and their stadium experience is the most cult-like I've been to yet\n10. An [Indiana State Park pass](https://stores.innsgifts.com/2022-annual-state-park-entrance-permit/) is a great value - even if it remains deeply strange that the state charges entrance fees for its parks\n11. Kentucky University football really likes to pretend the University of Louisville doesn't exist\n12. [Yuletide](http://www.indianapolissymphony.org/events/season-subscribe/series/yuletide/) is a really great holiday tradition we'll probably keep up from now on\n13. Throwing leftover chili, some cheese and whatnot on a baked potato is a surprisingly great lunch\n14. $1.50/slice pizza from a [hole in the wall pizza joint](https://www.2brospizza.com/) in NYC is _miles_ better than the fancy-ass pizza you get from the [Upscale Italian grocery store](https://www.eataly.com/us_en/) elsewhere in Manhattan. \n15. Takeout Chicago-style pizza _really_ needs to be held level on the way home to keep stuff from sliding around and off the pie\n16. Always have a spare battery, a lightning cable and a way to charge my Apple Watch when traveling - stuff goes dead and I'm toast without\n17. Walking tours are almost always worth the investment\n18. The cash you save by staying in the outskirts is outweighed by the time you lose in transit - the costs likely even out anyway\n19. A late snow - when you get it on early spring greenery - makes for a beautiful scene and hike\n20. Sous vide makes a beef roast really easy and pretty cost-effective (since you can use a cheaper cut and still get tasty outcomes)\n21. Backpacking is fun - but difficult to pull off without feeling guilty about leaving my family behind\n22. Despite years of avoiding it and being a generally scruffy-looking guy, I actually like shaving regularly\n23. I'm really not much of a beach person\n24. Or a pool person\n25. I can make bread!\n26. I like cooking for other people\n27. I can make pasta!\n28. Illinois football doesn't take itself too seriously - which is fun as a spectator\n29. Northwestern football - and Ryan Field in particular - feels like a time warp\n30. Public transportation makes travel way more fun\n31. Don't over schedule said travel. You'll end up buying tickets for things you don't go to\n32. Merino wool can be a bit pricey, but being able to pack less stuff makes it worth it\n33. I feel better about myself if I take just a few minutes each evening to wash my face before bed\n34. Having a bunch of cheap deli containers around the kitchen are really handy - and space-efficient in the fridge\n35. A grill basket really makes grilling various veggies way easier\n36. Homemade barbecue sauce isn't that difficult to pull off\n37. I like wearing sandals more than I would have thought\n38. I can replace the hardware on a dishwasher rack - and it's way cheaper than a new dishwasher\n39. Zero drop shoes cause immediate and massive blisters for me\n40. Having open and honest conversations at work can sometimes get you closer to what you want\n41. Actually thinking about what you want also gets you closer to what you want\n42. Prioritizing general things or themes - the big stuff - also helps\n43. Saying no and turning things off leaves room for some of that stuff you prioritized\n44. If you've prioritized something and it's still not progressing, maybe rethink your priorities or your approach. Or take smaller bites\n45. Little things done regularly have compounding value\n46. After buying many different ones over the years, it's time to admit that todo apps don't work for me\n47. My inner voice thinks I'm probably wrong, but in reality, I'm usually right\n48. Many things that say they are pest or rodent proof probably aren't\n49. There's a great - and mostly free - [electronics recycling place on Shadeland](https://gwcri.com/)\n50. Nobody knows what they're doing - including me\n51. Everybody is struggling in their own way\n52. Tomorrow can always be better than yesterday - but it might need a little push (it’s ok to not feel like pushing some days)\n",

				"content_text": "I grew up in my home state of West Virginia around college football.\n\nEach fall was spent either listening to the Mountaineers on hunting trips or traveling up to Morgantown for games.\n\nAfter a while, I started going to road games as well here and there.\n\nLater on, I started my career in sports departments of small West Virginia newspapers in Parkersburg and Clarksburg - eventually covering Marshall when Byron Leftwich was their quarterback.\n\nI've had that base of things in my life, when a few years ago, I got this notion of wanting to see a home game at every FBS college team.\n\nI'm up to 18 (of 130), and am knocking off a handful each year until my kids go off to start their adult lives and/or I retire some day in the future.\n\nFrom now on, I'll post more detailed things along the way, but I figured I'd load up the current list and state of things.\n\n## 2020\n\nNo progress here because _moves arms in a circle at the general state of the world in that year_.\n\n## 2019\n\n### Bowling Green at Buffalo - November 29, 2019\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/63ffecb470.jpg\" alt=\"35E3AE12 57E5 460C A253 94F0D543E688 1 105 c\" title=\"35E3AE12-57E5-460C-A253-94F0D543E688_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>Home team running onto the field.</blockquote>\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/bc23242837.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 5420\" title=\"IMG_5420.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"451\" height=\"600\" />\n<blockquote>One of the more-useful hats I collected along the way.</blockquote>\n\n[Game summary](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401119312)\n\n#### Observations\n\nBuffalo in late November is quite possibly the ideal state for this visit to a tiny stadium tucked away in a mostly residential area.\n\nAble to witness a nearly empty stadium, some light snowflakes, and a _huge_ day from Buffalo running back Jaret Patterson.\n\nBiggest oddity, though, was the lack of a halftime show of any sort ... and there was a band there (as you can see in the first photo).\n\nGood coffee, though.\n\n### UAB at Western Kentucky - September 28, 2019\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/e0bc7d85f8.jpg\" alt=\"6197F838 4BB2 4654 B360 D59BB3F1FBFB 1 105 c\" title=\"6197F838-4BB2-4654-B360-D59BB3F1FBFB_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>Fans in the stands</blockquote>\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/03dc23d69c.jpg\" alt=\"EBD782B3 A01C 497D 8076 734A4272F078 1 105 c\" title=\"EBD782B3-A01C-497D-8076-734A4272F078_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>Home team running on to the field</blockquote>\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/c50bffdd76.png\" alt=\"36E94B1A FB5C 4CC6 951F C24F68883360\" title=\"36E94B1A-FB5C-4CC6-951F-C24F68883360.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>Me and Big Red (in water cooler form)</blockquote>\n\n[Game summary](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401114273)\n\n#### Observations\n\nThe second stop of a double-header day (more below on the visit to Vanderbilt earlier in the day), WKU reminded me most of games I'd attended at Marshall - just red instead of green. \n\nOne of the few times since I've committed to this quest that I didn't pick up a hat - I couldn't find an in-stadium merch store. All I have from here are photos, a themed game day t-shirt, and a long-digested belly of [Cook Out](https://cookout.com/) for dinner beforehand.\n\nEnded up driving home to Indianapolis around halftime - rolling into my driveway near midnight.\n\n### Northern Illinois at Vanderbilt - September 28, 2019\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/7d415ef72a.png\" alt=\"D12A4A1D D8F5 48D5 A74B F3544BE2D863\" title=\"D12A4A1D-D8F5-48D5-A74B-F3544BE2D863.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>Likely my most-used hat from my trips so far - I can pretend the \"V\" stands for \"Vannoy\" instead of \"Vanderbilt\"</blockquote>\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/ed25f5c666.jpg\" alt=\"E0114308 1655 415A 891D C9DF1D122BFD 1 105 c\" title=\"E0114308-1655-415A-891D-C9DF1D122BFD_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>Sparsely attended ... though a surprisingly large contingent of Northern Illinois folks.</blockquote>\n\n[Game summary](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401110811)\n\n#### Observations\n\nWoke up and started my day with a drive down to Nashville - about four hours south of my home in Indianapolis - in tiem for this noon kickoff.\n\nVandy might be the weirdest of my trips so far (well, perhaps tied to Buffalo). It's a strange atmosphere mix of SEC money, MAC enthusiasm, and an urban campus. Huge production/scoreboard, announcers and the like and a very \"meh\" crowd reaction throughout.\n\nDidn't help that the home team struggled mightily with a middle of the pack MAC team.\n\n### Tennessee Tech at Miami (OH) - September 7, 2019\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/8f126e3d51.png\" alt=\"C992A0F2 9625 4F58 B9B7 1B41D4A2647A\" title=\"C992A0F2-9625-4F58-B9B7-1B41D4A2647A.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>I brought a buddy to this one!</blockquote>\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/ba602a386d.jpg\" alt=\"12207F1D 8D93 49D0 8E93 FC23D1C77708 1 105 c\" title=\"12207F1D-8D93-49D0-8E93-FC23D1C77708_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>The band is on the field!

It feels like a small library arts college - but it's a public Ohio university. A cute college town, a walkable campus, a fun culture and great small college atmosphere.\n\nSuper fun and I highly recommend it.\n\n### UCLA at Cincinnati - August 29, 2019\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/c30620e12a.jpg\" alt=\"E7A6DD3D 7284 4D75 8E92 5AF5188EAE4F 1 105 c\" title=\"E7A6DD3D-7284-4D75-8E92-5AF5188EAE4F_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/0212e80c02.jpg\" alt=\"B83CCD6D BEE3 493D B756 00A20DAF76DE 1 105 c\" title=\"B83CCD6D-BEE3-493D-B756-00A20DAF76DE_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/03909b3a9e.jpg\" alt=\"F5ADC631 9384 4370 A46A A974F61D1735 1 105 c\" title=\"F5ADC631-9384-4370-A46A-A974F61D1735_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/501141f980.png\" alt=\"E6485857 2F2C 41DB BE31 31E77D071883\" title=\"E6485857-2F2C-41DB-BE31-31E77D071883.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"451\" height=\"600\" />\n<blockquote>Nippert Stadium is really neat.</blockquote>\n\n[Game summary](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401117854)\n\n#### Observations\n\nNippert Stadium, where UC plays, is packed into and surrounded by this urban campus and is among the most unique venues I've been to.\n\nHelped to watch them kick off the season with a solid win.\n\nAlso relatively easy to get in and out of.\n\n## 2018\n\n### Buffalo at Toledo - October 20, 2018\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/1c335c8d98.jpg\" alt=\"ABB21F13 DB79 4301 ABF2 8C60A51B76FA 1 105 c\" title=\"ABB21F13-DB79-4301-ABF2-8C60A51B76FA_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>Brought my other buddy to this one</blockquote>\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/6892ef303f.jpg\" alt=\"4BD8FA8A 241A 4EE1 AF29 F87E99FEA51C 1 105 c\" title=\"4BD8FA8A-241A-4EE1-AF29-F87E99FEA51C_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/6e71b6549d.jpg\" alt=\"D56181A4 5565 4097 B3B7 BE934C89BFBE 1 105 c\" title=\"D56181A4-5565-4097-B3B7-BE934C89BFBE_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" />\n\n[Game summary](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401020763)\n\n#### Observations\n\nWith her brother spinning cubes at a [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) event down in Findlay, my daughter and I went north a bit to catch a game at The Glass Bowl in Toledo.\n\nNice fall day, cool old stadium, and I enjoy the pettiness of the rocket (pictured above) supposedly pointed on a trajectory that would hit the fifty yard line ~25 miles down the road at traditional arch-rival Bowling Green.\n\nGood local pizza, too.\n\n### West Virginia at Iowa State - October 13, 2018\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/548a0f23af.jpg\" alt=\"1B45A348 446A 42CF AEC4 939B1A8A5735 1 105 c\" title=\"1B45A348-446A-42CF-AEC4-939B1A8A5735_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>I usually root for the home team, but there are exceptions.</blockquote>\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/1358bb3a87.jpg\" alt=\"CB949895 F939 4099 B846 203B0B691DF1 1 105 c\" title=\"CB949895-F939-4099-B846-203B0B691DF1_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>As a WVU game, this sucked ... but as an Iowa State experience, it's hard to imagine better.</blockquote>\n\n[Game summary](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401013043)\n\n#### Observations\n\nReminded me an awful lot of WVU, which makes sense given the identical original stadium design. Ames is also a cute town, and it was fun to attend the official WVU tailgate thing before the game.\n\nAs I mentioned up the caption, as a WVU fan, this game _sucked_. We went in ranked #6 in the country and got positively pantsed.\n\nAs part of The Quest, though, this was probably the best-case scenario for seeing a night game in Ames.\n\nJust sucked to have it happen to my team.\n\nAnd the cookie-dough place in the stadium also sucked. Do better.\n\n### Indiana at Ohio State - October 6, 2018\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2021/8a091afb23.jpg\" alt=\"2EF904F1 885F 433A 990F 7C5EB1866FE8 1 105 c\" title=\"2EF904F1-885F-433A-990F-7C5EB1866FE8_1_105_c.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n<blockquote>Top row, behind the endzone.

It's better for everybody involved - you, your coworkers, the business, our customers - if that testing is automated.\n- That said, automated tests do not replace actual confirmation that our work is correct.\n- Related to the above, when fixing a bug, write a failing test case first.\n- What we hand off to QA or UAT or customers is - to the best of our knowledge and efforts to confirm - correct and ready to be in production.\n- If a PR has no tests, a reviewer has every right to reject said PR at their discretion.\n- Work with empathy - for your coworkers, for your future self and for our customers.\n- First you make it work, then you make it fast, then you make it pretty.\n",

				"title": "How I cook, January 2020",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>I’ve been diving deeper and deeper into a cooking rabbit hole over the last several years, and it really accelerated this year after a work colleague asked me “What do you do for fun?” and I couldn’t think of an answer and blurted out “Cooking”.</p>\n\n<p>And here we are. I&rsquo;m going to ramble a bit in the hopes that this is interesting to somebody - even if it&rsquo;s me a year from now when I can shake my head ruefully at how silly I was.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s a light day for me. For dinner, I’m making roasted asparagus, twice baked potatoes, and a pair of sous vide, bone-in pork chops. I’ll probably throw in a pan sauce of some sort as well.</p>\n\n<p>The first two of those are familiar: The asparagus is a family favorite and the twice baked potatoes I made on a whim a few weeks back and everybody liked them.</p>\n\n<p>The sous vide is still a new appliance for me. I made a turkey roulade for Christmas with it, and the turkey turned out perfectly moist, but I couldn’t effectively sear that big a mass. I’ve also made a chipotle chicken sort of thing in it for tacos which was fine I guess.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-setup\">The setup</h3>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/69792a19f2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 9232\" title=\"IMG_9232.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"443\" /></p>\n\n<p>Lately, I’ve been setting up our largest cutting board over a towel on one end of our kitchen island as a work station for all my prep work.</p>\n\n<p>I keep my chef’s knife next to the board and a bowl for scraps nearby.</p>\n\n<p>I also have a black cross-strapped (rather than one that ties behind your neck) apron to keep my clothes clean - or really, to give me a place to wipe my hands when I&rsquo;m in a hurry.</p>\n\n<p>If my family&rsquo;s out, I&rsquo;ll bring down my Bluetooth speaker and crank up some classic punk or heavy industrial while I prep and cook. If they&rsquo;re home (like the are today), I&rsquo;ll just use the iPhone speaker and keep it to something clean.</p>\n\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve cooked more and more, I&rsquo;ve learned the importance of prep work - or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place\">mise en place</a>. I look at the recipes I&rsquo;m cooking and get all the ingredients ready before anything starts cooking (an exception today might be throwing potatoes in the oven to bake while I prep the rest).</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also become a huge believer that you can&rsquo;t have enough towels (we&rsquo;re pushing twenty flour sack towels now) or enough bowls.</p>\n\n<p>The other adjustment I&rsquo;ve made over time is to make sure the dishwasher is empty (or at least dirty with room) and all hand-wash dishes are clean and put away before I start. I generate a lot of dirty dishes and need some out of the way place to put them - having an empty dishwasher works great for that (and makes later cleanup significantly easier).</p>\n\n<p>With all of that out of the way &hellip;</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-prep\">The prep</h3>\n\n<p>Like I said, today is pretty light.</p>\n\n<p>I need to poke some holes in some potatoes before chucking them into the oven for an hour.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/6b29c11309.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 4967\" title=\"IMG_4967.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>I need to mince some garlic for the asparagus, some more for the pan sauce, plus peel a clove for the chops. Aside: I didn&rsquo;t grow up with actual garlic being a thing. It&rsquo;s been one of the earliest and best revelations once I started trying to cook more seriously.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/71fe3c8478.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 0336\" title=\"IMG_0336.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"449\" /></p>\n\n<p>I need to trim the particularly woody ends from the asparagus.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/b9a680b164.png\" alt=\"IMG 5499\" title=\"IMG_5499.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>I need to cut up a green onion.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll need &frac12; cup of buttermilk, a 1/3 cup of sour cream, and a &frac14; of butter for the potatoes.</p>\n\n<p>After that, it&rsquo;s time to season the chops with salt and pepper and get them into a plastic bag. I didn&rsquo;t feel like dragging out the vacuum sealer for this, and ziploc bags work fine using the water displacement technique.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/6c3712efa1.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1565\" title=\"IMG_1565.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"449\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to plug in the immersion circulator and let it come up to temp - 147 degrees.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-cook\">The cook</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/383d2727e0.png\" alt=\"IMG 1264\" title=\"IMG_1264.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" style=\"float:right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Once it&rsquo;s at temp, it&rsquo;s time to drop in the chops and wait an hour.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the potatoes are done with the first bake. Time to let them cool a bit before ripping their guts out and mashing them to bits while adding all the other stuff (bacon bits! cheddar cheese! that dairy I mentioned earlier!)</p>\n\n<p>Then it&rsquo;s back into the oven for 20 minutes or so.</p>\n\n<p>The asparagus gets put on a baking sheet, doused in olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper and sprinkled with the minced garlic (aside: this is good with Parmesan cheese, too). They&rsquo;ll go in the oven after the potatoes, but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to get it prepped now.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/2e26e8a356.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 3154\" title=\"IMG_3154.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"449\" /></p>\n\n<p>The potatoes come out, and then I crank to oven to 450 degrees before throwing in the asparagus.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/a7c069e687.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1454\" title=\"IMG_1454.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the chops&rsquo; time in the water bath is up.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/f10c0f4de7.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1308\" title=\"IMG_1308.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>I get a pan heating to medium-high on the stove, while I taken them out of their bag (save the juice) and pat them dry with paper towels.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/3e6086ca51.png\" alt=\"IMG 8133\" title=\"IMG_8133.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" style=\"float:left;\" /></p>\n\n<p>A little vegetable oil in the pan, and in go the chops to sear - including the edges.</p>\n\n<p>Add a knob of butter and baste the chops with it a bit until everything looks crispy.</p>\n\n<p>Set those on the cutting board to slice in a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Pull the asparagus, turn off the oven.</p>\n\n<p>Add some garlic and then the pork juices from the bath to the pan to deglaze and reduce. A splash of apple cider vinegar. Finish by mounting the sauce with some butter and checking for seasoning.</p>\n\n<p>Plate everything up &hellip;</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-result\">The result</h3>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/8e9eae1240.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 2420\" title=\"IMG_2420.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"541\" /></p>\n\n<p>The pork looked amazing, but ended up pretty tough.

				"content_text": "I’ve been diving deeper and deeper into a cooking rabbit hole over the last several years, and it really accelerated this year after a work colleague asked me “What do you do for fun?” and I couldn’t think of an answer and blurted out “Cooking”.\n\nAnd here we are. I'm going to ramble a bit in the hopes that this is interesting to somebody - even if it's me a year from now when I can shake my head ruefully at how silly I was.\n\nToday’s a light day for me. For dinner, I’m making roasted asparagus, twice baked potatoes, and a pair of sous vide, bone-in pork chops. I’ll probably throw in a pan sauce of some sort as well.\n\nThe first two of those are familiar: The asparagus is a family favorite and the twice baked potatoes I made on a whim a few weeks back and everybody liked them. \n\nThe sous vide is still a new appliance for me. I made a turkey roulade for Christmas with it, and the turkey turned out perfectly moist, but I couldn’t effectively sear that big a mass. I’ve also made a chipotle chicken sort of thing in it for tacos which was fine I guess. \n\n### The setup\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/69792a19f2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 9232\" title=\"IMG_9232.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"443\" />\n\nLately, I’ve been setting up our largest cutting board over a towel on one end of our kitchen island as a work station for all my prep work. \n\nI keep my chef’s knife next to the board and a bowl for scraps nearby. \n\nI also have a black cross-strapped (rather than one that ties behind your neck) apron to keep my clothes clean - or really, to give me a place to wipe my hands when I'm in a hurry.\n\nIf my family's out, I'll bring down my Bluetooth speaker and crank up some classic punk or heavy industrial while I prep and cook. If they're home (like the are today), I'll just use the iPhone speaker and keep it to something clean.\n\nAs I've cooked more and more, I've learned the importance of prep work - or [mise en place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place). I look at the recipes I'm cooking and get all the ingredients ready before anything starts cooking (an exception today might be throwing potatoes in the oven to bake while I prep the rest).\n\nI've also become a huge believer that you can't have enough towels (we're pushing twenty flour sack towels now) or enough bowls. \n\nThe other adjustment I've made over time is to make sure the dishwasher is empty (or at least dirty with room) and all hand-wash dishes are clean and put away before I start. I generate a lot of dirty dishes and need some out of the way place to put them - having an empty dishwasher works great for that (and makes later cleanup significantly easier).\n\nWith all of that out of the way ...\n\n### The prep\n\nLike I said, today is pretty light. \n\nI need to poke some holes in some potatoes before chucking them into the oven for an hour.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/6b29c11309.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 4967\" title=\"IMG_4967.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nI need to mince some garlic for the asparagus, some more for the pan sauce, plus peel a clove for the chops. Aside: I didn't grow up with actual garlic being a thing. It's been one of the earliest and best revelations once I started trying to cook more seriously.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/71fe3c8478.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 0336\" title=\"IMG_0336.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"449\" />\n\nI need to trim the particularly woody ends from the asparagus.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/b9a680b164.png\" alt=\"IMG 5499\" title=\"IMG_5499.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nI need to cut up a green onion.\n\nI'll need 1/2 cup of buttermilk, a 1/3 cup of sour cream, and a 1/4 of butter for the potatoes.\n\nAfter that, it's time to season the chops with salt and pepper and get them into a plastic bag. I didn't feel like dragging out the vacuum sealer for this, and ziploc bags work fine using the water displacement technique. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/6c3712efa1.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1565\" title=\"IMG_1565.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"449\" />\n\nNow, it's time to plug in the immersion circulator and let it come up to temp - 147 degrees.\n\n### The cook\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/383d2727e0.png\" alt=\"IMG 1264\" title=\"IMG_1264.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" style=\"float:right;\" />\n\nOnce it's at temp, it's time to drop in the chops and wait an hour. \n\nMeanwhile, the potatoes are done with the first bake. Time to let them cool a bit before ripping their guts out and mashing them to bits while adding all the other stuff (bacon bits! cheddar cheese! that dairy I mentioned earlier!)\n\nThen it's back into the oven for 20 minutes or so.\n\nThe asparagus gets put on a baking sheet, doused in olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper and sprinkled with the minced garlic (aside: this is good with Parmesan cheese, too). They'll go in the oven after the potatoes, but it doesn't hurt to get it prepped now.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/2e26e8a356.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 3154\" title=\"IMG_3154.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"449\" />\n\nThe potatoes come out, and then I crank to oven to 450 degrees before throwing in the asparagus. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/a7c069e687.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1454\" title=\"IMG_1454.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the chops' time in the water bath is up. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/f10c0f4de7.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1308\" title=\"IMG_1308.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nI get a pan heating to medium-high on the stove, while I taken them out of their bag (save the juice) and pat them dry with paper towels. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/3e6086ca51.png\" alt=\"IMG 8133\" title=\"IMG_8133.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" style=\"float:left;\" />\n\nA little vegetable oil in the pan, and in go the chops to sear - including the edges.\n\nAdd a knob of butter and baste the chops with it a bit until everything looks crispy. \n\nSet those on the cutting board to slice in a few minutes. \n\nPull the asparagus, turn off the oven. \n\nAdd some garlic and then the pork juices from the bath to the pan to deglaze and reduce. A splash of apple cider vinegar. Finish by mounting the sauce with some butter and checking for seasoning. \n\nPlate everything up ...\n\n### The result\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://micro.chrisvannoy.com/uploads/2020/8e9eae1240.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 2420\" title=\"IMG_2420.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"541\" />\n\nThe pork looked amazing, but ended up pretty tough. Most of the family didn't finish, and I think I'm going to need to experiment a lot more with this sous vide machine because it's hit or miss on delivering what I expect. The pan sauce also didn't work ... I likely needed to empty to fat from the pan before adding the juice and trying to make a sauce.\n\nMeanwhile, that was about the best batch of asparagus I've made in a while and I think everybody went back for seconds of the twice-baked potatoes. \n\nRegardless, tomorrow I'm firing things up again to make stuff for my lunches (mashed cauliflower and roasted broccoli to go with some freezer turkey meatloaf) and a batch of chicken and broccoli mac and cheese for dinner with the kids. \n\nBut I'll save you those gory details ...\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I'm kicking off a new weekly feature today where I compile together links that caught my interest over the past week that are at least somewhat tangentially related to my in-progress book.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://peepcode.com/products/byc-michael-lopp\">Build Your Career: Michael Lopp (PeepCode)</a></h3>\n\n<p>Lopp, better known as <a href=\"http://www.randsinrepose.com/\">Rands</a> in some circles, has been a huge influence on me ever since I first stepped into management. This PeepCode course focused on managing your career as a developer is sure to be fantastic. Were I still developing, it'd plunk down the $12 immediately. I'd suggest you do the same.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://basho.com/erlang-at-basho-five-years-later/\">Erlang at Basho, Five Years Later</a></h3>\n\n<p>Basho, the makers of the <a href=\"http://basho.com/riak/\">Riak</a> database mention one key point in this blog post: That they sought out developers who knew the subject matter much more than developers who had experience with the specific programming language they were using (Erlang).</p>\n\n<p>I go into this quite a bit in my book. More than knowledge of your specific programming language, you want to look for developers who have knowledge of and experience with multiple languages.

				"content_text": "\n<p>I'm kicking off a new weekly feature today where I compile together links that caught my interest over the past week that are at least somewhat tangentially related to my in-progress book.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://peepcode.com/products/byc-michael-lopp\">Build Your Career: Michael Lopp (PeepCode)</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lopp, better known as <a href=\"http://www.randsinrepose.com/\">Rands</a> in some circles, has been a huge influence on me ever since I first stepped into management. This PeepCode course focused on managing your career as a developer is sure to be fantastic. Were I still developing, it'd plunk down the $12 immediately. I'd suggest you do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://basho.com/erlang-at-basho-five-years-later/\">Erlang at Basho, Five Years Later</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Basho, the makers of the <a href=\"http://basho.com/riak/\">Riak</a> database mention one key point in this blog post: That they sought out developers who knew the subject matter much more than developers who had experience with the specific programming language they were using (Erlang).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I go into this quite a bit in my book. More than knowledge of your specific programming language, you want to look for developers who have knowledge of and experience with multiple languages. You want folks that are curious and able to pick up new concepts and languages quickly, so it makes sense to find folks who have demonstrated that ability already.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/how-manage-remote-team/\">21 Months In: How to Manage a Remote Team</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't currently manage a remote team, but this post is filled with practical advice and tips for how you should go about it.

Fill out the Skills section. Link up your social accounts — or better: a personal site, Dribbble and/or Github profiles.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, make it as complete as you can.</p>\n\n<p>In the contact area settings, make sure you have it set for &ldquo;career opportunities&rdquo; and &ldquo;job inquiries&rdquo;.
